1718	835351081945350145	Elon Musk	2017-02-25 04:49:52	@DueDiamond maybe one of those too
1719	835350234049863680	Elon Musk	2017-02-25 04:46:30	Roller coasters are awesome
1720	835202594968477696	Elon Musk	2017-02-24 18:59:50	@johnpaulbrewer Something on a tristate border might work. Gigafactory plus nearby supporting supply chain needs a very large workforce.
1721	835187859158020097	Elon Musk	2017-02-24 18:01:17	@donbarbieri @GreenCarReports Good chance it will
1722	835187686151315456	Elon Musk	2017-02-24 18:00:36	@davidshepardson @BW @ATT @ToysRUs Exactly :)
1723	835185478512992256	Elon Musk	2017-02-24 17:51:49	@meganmurp @ChrisFaile @BW I didn't pose for it (hopefully that's obvious) or want me on cover. Tunnel boring machine pic wd be way better
1724	835178020604301313	Elon Musk	2017-02-24 17:22:11	@adrianvolts Minor improvements update this weekend. High speed autosteer in about two weeks.
1725	834740218531962881	Elon Musk	2017-02-23 12:22:31	Excellent Tesla Model X review https://t.co/wvog4Pbo1o
1726	833411017065394176	Elon Musk	2017-02-19 20:20:45	Just posted a video https://t.co/RCV7MVi8rs
1727	833332384913252352	Elon Musk	2017-02-19 15:08:17	https://t.co/6Ve3YJoStm
1728	833332058453790720	Elon Musk	2017-02-19 15:06:59	Baby came back https://t.co/5FRhw3AT2b
1729	833329896168370179	Elon Musk	2017-02-19 14:58:24	@mattnewby no
1730	832995083519614976	Elon Musk	2017-02-18 16:47:58	@Xuan_Thai System was green for launch. I called it off.
1731	832992529872097280	Elon Musk	2017-02-18 16:37:50	@spacecom They are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much R&amp;D risk on Dragon 2, that I feel very confident of 2018.
1732	832986598627106818	Elon Musk	2017-02-18 16:14:15	@zperrin99 Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed
1733	832984361989386240	Elon Musk	2017-02-18 16:05:22	Btw, 99% likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that 1% chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day.
1734	832979955092819968	Elon Musk	2017-02-18 15:47:51	@Zybbby Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question
1735	832973218348625920	Elon Musk	2017-02-18 15:21:05	If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause
1736	832970849791537152	Elon Musk	2017-02-18 15:11:41	All systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate.
1737	832871068066942976	Elon Musk	2017-02-18 08:35:11	Counting down to the first SpaceX launch from the Apollo 11 launch pad tomorrow morning (webcast‚Ä¶ https://t.co/upjTcmftte
1738	832868838479851521	Elon Musk	2017-02-18 08:26:19	spacex's photo https://t.co/ImEDAut3nI
1739	832863988836814848	Elon Musk	2017-02-18 08:07:03	Provided Dragon 2 demo missions go well, SpaceX is highly confident of being able to fly US astronauts in 2018 https://t.co/usUto6QSi7
1740	832788691588296705	Elon Musk	2017-02-18 03:07:51	Looks like we are go for launch. Added an abort trigger at T-60 secs for pressure decay of upper stage helium spin start system.
1741	832647116816150530	Elon Musk	2017-02-17 17:45:17	Investigating a (very small) leak in the upper stage. If ok, will launch tomorrow. https://t.co/bQf97lywn4
1742	832619549937668096	Elon Musk	2017-02-17 15:55:44	@emenietti @chafkin Yes, but only deep in solid rock, where the walls are self-supporting and concrete reinforcements arguably aren't needed
1743	832480331496185857	Elon Musk	2017-02-17 06:42:32	@sc00bs It's much easier to do the CGI that way
1744	832375525754626048	Elon Musk	2017-02-16 23:46:04	Daylight rocket launch &amp; landing at the Cape this weekend. Will be the 1st SpaceX flight from the Apollo launch pad. https://t.co/Vr5LQjYaPZ
1745	832089102266687488	Elon Musk	2017-02-16 04:47:56	@PhoebeColeman I used that one :)
1746	832086901704126464	Elon Musk	2017-02-16 04:39:11	Ok, what are some good ones? Will have to meter these out. Hopefully, kids can't die from groaning too much.
1747	832086234302341120	Elon Musk	2017-02-16 04:36:32	@VRGTech @Floydilicious They are doing India proud
1748	832085891715723264	Elon Musk	2017-02-16 04:35:10	@osiris26 You may come to regret that request :)
1749	832085554619572225	Elon Musk	2017-02-16 04:33:50	@LittleDovah Yeah, exactly. So that makes it cool, right!?
1750	832084918645596166	Elon Musk	2017-02-16 04:31:18	@Floydilicious Yeah, awesome achievement by ISRO. Very impressive!
1751	832084402473627650	Elon Musk	2017-02-16 04:29:15	"Apparently, there is this thing called ""Dad jokes"" and I make them"
1752	832082377920778240	Elon Musk	2017-02-16 04:21:12	@LudwigMorelos You're right, I can't hide any more! I am Irony Man...
1753	831972894355828736	Elon Musk	2017-02-15 21:06:09	@Samcornwell they were earlier drafts that I accidentally published. I said the same thing a week already.
1754	831972613912080384	Elon Musk	2017-02-15 21:05:03	In appreciation, Tesla is providing all repair costs free of charge and expedited. https://t.co/D68HNJcCoQ
1755	831969536584806400	Elon Musk	2017-02-15 20:52:49	Congrats to the Tesla owner who sacrificed damage to his own car to bring a car with an unconscious driver safely to a stop!
1756	831692803210096641	Elon Musk	2017-02-15 02:33:11	@lollieshopMOM Best place to watch is on the Cape causeway
1757	830239445433544704	Elon Musk	2017-02-11 02:18:03	@SEACityLight @Nas2four Sounds like the Tesla Powerwall (consumer) and Powerpack (utility/commercial) might be useful
1758	830148763578662916	Elon Musk	2017-02-10 20:17:43	Falcon 9 rocket now vertical at Cape Canaveral on launch complex 39-A. This is the same launch‚Ä¶ https://t.co/wY6dWRcer3
1759	829885356531032064	Elon Musk	2017-02-10 02:51:02	@accohen @MeganGeuss @arstechnica Exactly. What this person said is untrue.
1760	829861775357071361	Elon Musk	2017-02-10 01:17:19	@RusulAlrubail @MarkRuffalo @guardian Please check your facts. Tesla and SpaceX joined as soon as we received the filing, which was Monday.
1761	829509777218613248	Elon Musk	2017-02-09 01:58:37	@dknisely of course it will
1762	829447188325412866	Elon Musk	2017-02-08 21:49:54	@SundalJ Should all be uploaded by next month
1763	829442592978792448	Elon Musk	2017-02-08 21:31:39	@sureal808 Motor Trend could only achieve 2.4 sec when they tested the Porsche 918
1764	829441987686182912	Elon Musk	2017-02-08 21:29:14	@VoltzCoreAudio I don't know what make you think that's a rocket. It's completely covered in a tarpaulin...
1765	829396254920568832	Elon Musk	2017-02-08 18:27:31	George Schultz and Jim Baker article in @WSJ regarding a carbon tax https://t.co/tf2Urgms85
1766	829046669517860869	Elon Musk	2017-02-07 19:18:23	@BatlaG yes
1767	829027848434257924	Elon Musk	2017-02-07 18:03:36	@goel_ishan Hoping for summer this year
1768	829015254524792832	Elon Musk	2017-02-07 17:13:33	@mdcdave yes, altitude improves performance for electric. Opposite of combustion cars.
1769	829002643947167744	Elon Musk	2017-02-07 16:23:27	@jovanik21 @Veidit No, will be lower. Wheelbase can't fit 100.
1770	828999653886550018	Elon Musk	2017-02-07 16:11:34	@jovanik21 Also, Tesla service can remove front trunk liner if you don't use it and improve performance further
1771	828998837578526723	Elon Musk	2017-02-07 16:08:19	@Veidit No plans to take X, S (or 3) above 100 kWh. Semi necessarily and pickup truck maybe will go above.
1772	828984746029912064	Elon Musk	2017-02-07 15:12:19	@jovanik21 Take out the floor mats and its 2.27. MT said everything had to be standard production.
1773	828983364543664128	Elon Musk	2017-02-07 15:06:50	@quick_pi yes
1774	828981873086865410	Elon Musk	2017-02-07 15:00:54	Production Tesla Model S P100DL sets Motor Trend all-time world record to 60 mph in 2.27 sec https://t.co/sxALQrM5Ls
1775	828320620463140865	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 19:13:20	Signing off now. That was more than enough Twitter trouble for one morning!
1776	828315290782093312	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:52:09	@qriosity_ @MacTechGenius No rare earth metals in battery
1777	828314791819218944	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:50:10	@camdtor @trylks Almost ready
1778	828314321679704066	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:48:18	@MacTechGenius App update is about two weeks out. Linux kernel and browser update probably a month or so. HW2 Autopilot has priority.
1779	828312660299091968	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:41:42	@FredericLambert Yes, but Model 3 is the overwhelming priority
1780	828312511946567680	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:41:06	@clay_ellis I will post an article he wrote half a century ago about flying through Africa and Asia in his plane. One of my favorite things.
1781	828309896122789889	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:30:43	@christesla @FredericLambert Almost there. We are just being very careful with the rollout.
1782	828307625632813056	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:21:41	@trylks A lot of terrible things could happen in four years of extremism. Do you really want another war? That's where extremism leads.
1783	828305244891336706	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:12:14	@FredericLambert Yeah, it is hard to convey complex ideas in 140 chars and tone is lost in text
1784	828304178644656129	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:07:59	@CycleTrades @rtoro20 People should push to have as many moderates advising the President as possible. Blind hate is never the right answer.
1785	828303494981550082	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:05:16	@Wise1919 @FredericLambert Rolling out a new update today.
1786	828303126935568384	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:03:49	@recipher We should try our best
1787	828302292520681474	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:00:30	@iamDeveloper Really? Ok, I will work harder on thinking first and tweeting second. Sorry for anything thoughtless.
1788	828301829909921792	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:58:40	@martinengwicht @FredericLambert I just had three coffees :)
1789	828301680596889600	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:58:04	@thelogicbox @IanrossWins Mars is critical for the long-term survival of humanity and life on Earth as we know it
1790	828301040768393216	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:55:31	@seanbroswag @FredericLambert Numeric
1791	828300568062021632	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:53:39	@B0Turner Gravimetric energy density of batteries and achieving a high cell mass fraction
1792	828300245998116864	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:52:22	@Travelingmom23 I love Canada! I'm half Canadian. My Mom was born in Regina. My grandfather (her Dad) was American, born in Minnesota.
1793	828299070154358784	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:47:42	@FredericLambert Me too. I hope to get back to regularly scheduled programming soon ...
1794	828298780638400512	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:46:33	@brendangage I agree, great country! Looking forward to taking my kids for a visit. I've heard it is incredibly beautiful.
1795	828297954314289153	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:43:15	@rtoro20 Really? I already have both feet in my mouth and am levitating on my own idiocy...
1796	828297337353154560	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:40:48	@DaringKid True. Me being one of them :)
1797	828297251026001924	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:40:28	"@marcelsalathe Not perfect &amp; cd be better, but 10th out of 200+ countries with only a 0.08 diff to ""1st"" place means it's essentially on par"
1798	828294008677994496	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:27:35	@andresantoniop Fair point, sorry
1799	828293735419109376	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:26:30	Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?
1800	828292953798012932	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:23:23	@RealPhillipPoon Needs a major overhaul
1801	828292305522192384	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:20:49	@BenCam137 @FifthRocket Exactly
1802	828291884858691584	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:19:08	@AanstadGard Norway is great on all levels. Love Norway!
1803	828291645548408833	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:18:11	@BullFlags Yeah. And Twitter is a hater Hellscape.
1804	828291190965551106	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:16:23	"@W4AS Good grief, I'm not ""working"" for Trump. I'm trying to provide advice that helps take things in a more positive direction."
1805	828290224069419010	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:12:32	@BitterMercy @CallumK24 Actually, I think it's kinda cool :)
1806	828289948767895552	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:11:27	@EricHaegler @iLexomat Isn't that basically like having a jury of peers? That is a default option in the US.
1807	828289487075733504	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:09:37	@vladsavov Those countries have strong justice systems, but I'd put them roughly on par with US. That rating system conflates many factors.
1808	828287608614744064	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:02:09	@FifthRocket Did you read my tweets? I attacked it hard. Did not defend.
1809	828287354741936130	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:01:08	@KENEMONICS You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
1810	828285894570422272	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 16:55:20	@martinengwicht Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.
1811	828285409675341824	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 16:53:25	@paulvankeep Mostly anti-drug laws
1812	828284802327523328	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 16:51:00	@zgiarrizzo Exactly
1813	828284631170560000	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 16:50:19	@TheLAAdams The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law.
1814	828284048103579651	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 16:48:00	@humplik The remedy for that is changing the law
1815	828282768559849473	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 16:42:55	@CallumK24 Ok, but what's up the wigs?
1816	828282648711802881	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 16:42:26	@iLexomat There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.
1817	828281953455579136	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 16:39:41	@Biesseman True!
1818	828280866451374085	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 16:35:21	Many in America don't realize how proud they should be of the legal system. Not perfect, but nowhere is the cause of justice better served.
1819	828018446873006080	Elon Musk	2017-02-04 23:12:36	Walking down the street and saw this https://t.co/Mpv5j6088K
1820	828004976228188160	Elon Musk	2017-02-04 22:19:04	@ChrisJCav Maybe my favorite mug ever
1821	828004231101706241	Elon Musk	2017-02-04 22:16:06	@nintendomaniac @alext4627 I wish!
1822	828002410811494400	Elon Musk	2017-02-04 22:08:52	@OldManRiver1800 Then so be it. I'd rather do what I believe is right, than do what appears right simply to avoid criticism.
1823	828000753432293376	Elon Musk	2017-02-04 22:02:17	@bonnienorman @advandermeer Wow, cool!
1824	828000589082742784	Elon Musk	2017-02-04 22:01:38	@alext4627 That's exactly what I thought. Love Half-Life.
1825	827999209085403143	Elon Musk	2017-02-04 21:56:09	@ana_lontana Nuances are important :)
1826	827983309359763456	Elon Musk	2017-02-04 20:52:58	Rainbows, unicorns and electric cars https://t.co/oGHkVUmpdi
1827	827954983710650369	Elon Musk	2017-02-04 19:00:25	26 ft diameter tunnel running 2 miles under D.C. https://t.co/XFQkioEsg8

2053	790245808864043009	Elon Musk	2016-10-23 17:37:37	AMA at &lt;ahem&gt; 3pm California time
2054	789902046430269440	Elon Musk	2016-10-22 18:51:38	Must be a coincidence https://t.co/qX6xYrQZpp
2055	789024901629816832	Elon Musk	2016-10-20 08:46:10	@PraneshSuvarna @YouTube no, that's real

2058	789022017311735808	Elon Musk	2016-10-20 08:34:42	When you want your car to return, tap Summon on your phone. It will eventually find you even if you are on the other side of the country
2059	789020841489018880	Elon Musk	2016-10-20 08:30:02	When searching for parking, the car reads the signs to see if it is allowed to park there, which is why it skipped the disabled spot
2060	789020178969276416	Elon Musk	2016-10-20 08:27:24	@Bret_with1t yes
2061	789020098145030144	Elon Musk	2016-10-20 08:27:05	@TeslaMotors 8 cameras, 12 ultrasonars and radar all flush mounted and body color. Beauty remains.
2062	789019145853513729	Elon Musk	2016-10-20 08:23:18	Tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway to streets, then finds a parking spot https://t.co/V2T7KGMPBo
2063	789008557341454336	Elon Musk	2016-10-20 07:41:13	@vicentes latest autonomous hardware allows for easy computer upgrade
2064	789007996038721536	Elon Musk	2016-10-20 07:38:59	Should mention that retrofitting to full self-driving hardware is very difficult. Cost delta is more than buying a new car. Wish it weren't.
2065	789004268296544256	Elon Musk	2016-10-20 07:24:11	@elonmusk Still working on the video. Fully autonomous drive demo only completed several hours ago.
2066	788973638665908224	Elon Musk	2016-10-20 05:22:28	@AlternateJones of course
2067	788955029138972674	Elon Musk	2016-10-20 04:08:31	Tesla expects to demonstrate self-driven cross-country trip next year https://t.co/YTxMUT3hWq via @WSJ
2068	788904960331161600	Elon Musk	2016-10-20 00:49:34	@FutureBoy @mashable true and underappreciated
2069	788902908175618049	Elon Musk	2016-10-20 00:41:25	Will post video of a Tesla navigating a complex urban environment shortly. That was what took the extra couple of days.
2070	788823067392749568	Elon Musk	2016-10-19 19:24:09	@elonmusk This is also what I was alluding to by Model 3 part 2
2071	788809242769666048	Elon Musk	2016-10-19 18:29:13	According to experts, Hyperloop is both obvious and impossible. Maybe pick one or the other? https://t.co/JkRWd0lFS8
2072	788794291900469248	Elon Musk	2016-10-19 17:29:48	Tesla announcement goes live at 5pm California time. 30 minutes of media Q&amp;A to follow.
2073	788782966528815104	Elon Musk	2016-10-19 16:44:48	Calculated attempt to deceive Florida voters about solar vote uncovered by Miami Herald https://t.co/dvwaU87PmG
2074	788625768368762880	Elon Musk	2016-10-19 06:20:09	Tesla does 0-60 mph in 2.7 seconds in the rain https://t.co/Z3YA4igGE1 via @electrekco
2075	788493472286121984	Elon Musk	2016-10-18 21:34:27	@FortuneMagazine This is because the first 12 months of production are sold out
2076	787797036699521024	Elon Musk	2016-10-16 23:27:04	Moving the Tesla announcement to Wednesday. Needs a few more days of refinement.
2077	787775297521233920	Elon Musk	2016-10-16 22:00:41	@markpinc @TeslaMotors thanks!
2078	787721971417034752	Elon Musk	2016-10-16 18:28:47	@Reuters Umm...Autobahn?
2079	786601762354442242	Elon Musk	2016-10-13 16:17:29	@vicentes obviously wrong
2080	785517307476922370	Elon Musk	2016-10-10 16:28:14	@Cocoanetics @heiseonline Not actually based on science. Objective data shows Autopilot is safer than manually driven cars.
2081	785505765343625216	Elon Musk	2016-10-10 15:42:23	@saufkopf87 @FortuneMagazine Utter nonsense. Empirical evidence is what matters, not random speculation.
2082	785495295652167680	Elon Musk	2016-10-10 15:00:46	@jovanik21 @arstechnica @drgitlin Sounds like a great move!
2083	785494639029719040	Elon Musk	2016-10-10 14:58:10	Good for Germany! https://t.co/SMdOL9GcTl
2084	785488210629537792	Elon Musk	2016-10-10 14:32:37	@hohocho That's why we need to accelerate solar power
2085	785485969705140224	Elon Musk	2016-10-10 14:23:43	"Real fraud going on is denial of climate science. As for ""subsidies"", Tesla gets pennies on dollar vs coal. How about we both go to zero?"
2086	785483088109326337	Elon Musk	2016-10-10 14:12:16	Coal-mining CEO: 'Tesla is a fraud' https://t.co/IpQJAlAo3f via @YahooFinance

2089	785140287819612160	Elon Musk	2016-10-09 15:30:06	@roger_kappler Probably not then either
2090	785139055793152000	Elon Musk	2016-10-09 15:25:12	Would also like to correct expectations that Tesla/SolarCity will need to raise equity or corp debt in Q4. Won't be necessary for either.
2091	785138151224446976	Elon Musk	2016-10-09 15:21:37	Tesla product unveiling on the 17th (unexpected by most), followed by Tesla/SolarCity on the 28th
2092	785135480811712513	Elon Musk	2016-10-09 15:11:00	@FuncRandm I agree. Speed of light is a point in favor of the sim.
2093	784507684410097664	Elon Musk	2016-10-07 21:36:22	US automotive deaths rose 10% to 17,775 in first half of 2016, approx 1 every 88 million miles https://t.co/8vrAHA80yB
2094	784487348562198529	Elon Musk	2016-10-07 20:15:33	Cumulative Tesla Autopilot miles now at 222 million
2095	784441057857589249	Elon Musk	2016-10-07 17:11:37	@DanMerriweather lot of circumstantial evidence for that hypothesis
2096	783847197427335172	Elon Musk	2016-10-06 01:51:49	@derektmead Thus I deserve to be top of the target list? Maybe there's a dude who really digs the color gold who is slightly more deserving‚Ä¶
2097	783842202220802048	Elon Musk	2016-10-06 01:31:58	@YostRobert @StephenAtHome Yeah, and several others at various times. My twitter list is trimmed down to almost all news/comedy these days.
2098	783759011724210176	Elon Musk	2016-10-05 20:01:24	@mrDeanMiller When we upgrade the core Linux OS to 4.4, which is probably December
2099	783567161402888192	Elon Musk	2016-10-05 07:19:03	Sabotage of the rocket is unlikely, but this article has some great theories :)https://t.co/1fCRbZvRHo
2100	783358546519793664	Elon Musk	2016-10-04 17:30:06	@Cardoso True, it is a no-win situation
2101	783347230245736448	Elon Musk	2016-10-04 16:45:08	@motherboard I use twitter for news orgs. My Insta has same women as men. What's up with the phoney PC police axe-grinding?
2102	782702761464827904	Elon Musk	2016-10-02 22:04:14	@kakurady @xenophrenia Exactly. Those are the best ones.
2103	782666277256957952	Elon Musk	2016-10-02 19:39:16	@MacTechGenius Going out this week for X and outside North America
2104	782643630586535936	Elon Musk	2016-10-02 18:09:17	Wow, this tweet is like a Rorschach test
2105	782642916887924737	Elon Musk	2016-10-02 18:06:26	"No irony or uhh ""shade"" meant here. T's character is excellent and well-played. Worth seeing."
2106	782640044599152640	Elon Musk	2016-10-02 17:55:02	Some of the future episodes of Westworld feature my ex. Talulah does a great job of playing a deadly sexbot :)

2110	781264006145335297	Elon Musk	2016-09-28 22:47:08	@SteveBatzer @GoodDayM Corrective action taken. Seems to be limited to a small number of cases, but thanks for lett‚Ä¶ https://t.co/vrtlttgFwb
2111	781208371378520065	Elon Musk	2016-09-28 19:06:04	@GoodDayM Am tracking this down ... Super important to be fair. There are zero discounts even for family and friends.
2112	781208061994119168	Elon Musk	2016-09-28 19:04:50	@GoodDayM Something messed up here. Tesla policy is equal pricing for all. No discounts ever unless a car is a floor model or was damaged.
2113	781206685553528833	Elon Musk	2016-09-28 18:59:22	@BArtusio Three cable elevator on a crane. Wind force on Mars is low, so don't need to worry about being blown around.

2116	780838839644483586	Elon Musk	2016-09-27 18:37:41	Waiting for everyone to reach their seats and get settled. Starting in 5 to 10.
2117	780831628104966144	Elon Musk	2016-09-27 18:09:01	12m rocket booster diameter, 17m spaceship diameter, 122 m stack height
2118	780828210028240896	Elon Musk	2016-09-27 17:55:27	Full Interplanetary Tranport System presentation in ~30 mins. Simulation preview: https://t.co/lKAxabzfKX
2119	780608204833165316	Elon Musk	2016-09-27 03:21:13	@rocketrepreneur Meant to say 200 AR for production vac engine. Dev will be up to 150. Beyond that, too much flow separation in Earth atmos.
2120	780491677567815680	Elon Musk	2016-09-26 19:38:11	@ID_AA_Carmack yup

2124	780291118080462848	Elon Musk	2016-09-26 06:21:14	@rocketrepreneur 382s is with a 150 area ratio vacuum (or Mars ambient pressure) nozzle. Will go over specs for both versions on Tues.
2125	780289045238657024	Elon Musk	2016-09-26 06:13:00	Chamber pressure is almost 3X Merlin, so engine is about the same size for a given area ratio
2126	780280440401764353	Elon Musk	2016-09-26 05:38:48	Production Raptor goal is specific impulse of 382 seconds and thrust of 3 MN (~310 metric tons) at 300 bar

2140	778603745915527173	Elon Musk	2016-09-21 14:36:13	Can be turned on or off. V8.1 will allow always-on min and max temps to be set.
2141	778602694399320065	Elon Musk	2016-09-21 14:32:02	Tesla keeps temp below 40C/105F by automatically venting cabin &amp; turning on AC when needed. Can do this for up to a year on a full charge.
2142	778602042759585793	Elon Musk	2016-09-21 14:29:27	My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.
2143	778600126063390720	Elon Musk	2016-09-21 14:21:50	This is a major overhaul on almost every level compared to V7.
2144	778599820227252225	Elon Musk	2016-09-21 14:20:37	V8.0 starts downloading tonight. Release will be gradual to make sure there aren't small regressions. Many car configs, many environments.

2151	776959933120000000	Elon Musk	2016-09-17 01:44:17	@TheMikeBartley yeah!
2152	776959734104469504	Elon Musk	2016-09-17 01:43:30	Maybe Ultimate Spaceship, Version 2? Mostly because it is not the ultimate and there isn't a version 1.
2153	776957948928991232	Elon Musk	2016-09-17 01:36:24	I love the suggestions!

2168	774257337221517312	Elon Musk	2016-09-09 14:45:08	@abadcliche Most likely true, but we can't yet find it on any vehicle sensors
2169	774155658476212224	Elon Musk	2016-09-09 08:01:06	Will get back to Autopilot update blog tomorrow.

2172	774153847371501569	Elon Musk	2016-09-09 07:53:54	Particularly trying to understand the quieter bang sound a few seconds before the fireball goes off. May come from rocket or something else.
2173	774152037927792640	Elon Musk	2016-09-09 07:46:43	Support &amp; advice from @NASA, @FAA, @AFPAA &amp; others much appreciated. Please email any recordings of the event to report@spacex.com.
2174	774150289314029568	Elon Musk	2016-09-09 07:39:46	Important to note that this happened during a routine filling operation. Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source.
2175	774150065166229504	Elon Musk	2016-09-09 07:38:53	Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation. Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years.
2176	774101759023128576	Elon Musk	2016-09-09 04:26:56	@waitbutwhy It's been a little crazy lately
2177	771479910778966016	Elon Musk	2016-09-01 22:48:38	@scrappydog yes. This seems instant from a human perspective, but it really a fast fire, not an explosion. Dragon would have been fine.

2180	771010406894620672	Elon Musk	2016-08-31 15:43:00	@Lockyep Not allowed, according to HK regulations. Happy to do it if regs change.

2202	759798110470205440	Elon Musk	2016-07-31 17:09:20	@JamesRossi100 probably makes sense to build off the pickup truck chassis

2388	738805691528318976	Elon Musk	2016-06-03 18:52:57	Just heard that Norway will ban new sales of fuel cars in 2025. What an amazingly awesome country. You guys rock!! https://t.co/uAXuBkDYuR
2389	738775567055523841	Elon Musk	2016-06-03 16:53:15	Yay, baby made it home!https://t.co/KYyUX9zNYD
2390	738471747540783104	Elon Musk	2016-06-02 20:45:59	@mattyteare @karaswisher @waltmossberg @YouTube autosteering chutes will be added soon
2391	738470842695176192	Elon Musk	2016-06-02 20:42:23	Recode interview with @karaswisher and @waltmossberg https://t.co/BDqQ7RreV2 via @YouTube
2392	738191872502423552	Elon Musk	2016-06-02 02:13:52	Supercharger policy explained well by @LATimes:https://t.co/F0CInMW1yUWill post detailed description soon. I think it's a good balance.
2393	737859967450021889	Elon Musk	2016-06-01 04:14:59	Good summary of Tesla annual meeting by @katiefehren https://t.co/G3enS77hJ7
2394	737102578828206080	Elon Musk	2016-05-30 02:05:24	@iwanttobeanurse Sorry to hear that. Will take care of this &amp; investigate to see if issues you encountered are systemic.
2395	736787058170068993	Elon Musk	2016-05-29 05:11:38	So it was good for you too ... https://t.co/9cxo39N1lQ
2396	736380977354657792	Elon Musk	2016-05-28 02:18:00	Fast replay of today's rocket landing on SpaceX droneship OCISLYhttps://t.co/I0QQ2D3BtE
2397	736373856823181312	Elon Musk	2016-05-28 01:49:43	@dfjsteve Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard.
2398	736328917317910528	Elon Musk	2016-05-27 22:51:08	Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
2399	736320322996076548	Elon Musk	2016-05-27 22:16:59	Rocket landing speed was close to design max &amp; used up contingency crush core, hence back &amp; forth motion. Prob ok, but some risk of tipping.
2400	736319295345434625	Elon Musk	2016-05-27 22:12:54	Satellite deployed to 91,000 km apogee. All looks good.
2401	736310020644569088	Elon Musk	2016-05-27 21:36:03	3 mins to launch https://t.co/i5jNDs9MCO
2402	735965207625932801	Elon Musk	2016-05-26 22:45:53	@SpaceX There was a tiny glitch in the motion of an upper stage engine actuator. Probably not a flight risk, but still worth investigating.
2403	735480275988156418	Elon Musk	2016-05-25 14:38:57	Really fun Model X review by @MotorTrend. Best part is X racing while towing a fuel sports carhttps://t.co/0KzOpoIarx
2404	734274360588926976	Elon Musk	2016-05-22 06:47:04	@SchaFFFFFF Flight 24 is def capable of flying again, but it makes sense to apply ground delta qual to rocket w toughest entry conditions.
2405	733362268570669056	Elon Musk	2016-05-19 18:22:44	Great image of ancient Mars https://t.co/iy3AngxKlq
2406	733021242744135680	Elon Musk	2016-05-18 19:47:37	@jlgolson No prob. We care about doing what's fair &amp; just. Don't always get it right, but intent is always there &amp; we make amends when wrong
2407	733016945654517760	Elon Musk	2016-05-18 19:30:33	@jlgolson Per the letter, Tesla paid $55/hr for *additional* services, so no.
2408	733009265288314881	Elon Musk	2016-05-18 19:00:02	@jlgolson Yes, but it is false of Merc News to say that Tesla took advantage of low cost labor. We paid $55/hr. That is unequivocal.
2409	733007602565570560	Elon Musk	2016-05-18 18:53:25	We still need to make sure that the injured person is taken care of, but less &amp; less of the Merc story appears to be true
2410	733007230149107712	Elon Musk	2016-05-18 18:51:56	Merc News story about Tesla using $5/hr labor seems to be missing a digit. Tesla actually paid $55/hr. https://t.co/2dTH0ncdKX
2411	732656393463832576	Elon Musk	2016-05-17 19:37:50	@drkevinleung @Tesla_Canada Totally agree. Am told this will be fixed by Thurs, maybe Fri.
2412	732330010053222400	Elon Musk	2016-05-16 22:00:55	@joshuapinter @juliusvolz Full height of Falcon 9 boost stage on legs is ~165 ft
2413	732329443776024576	Elon Musk	2016-05-16 21:58:40	Falcon Heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as Falcon 9, but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer loads.
2414	732247546924388353	Elon Musk	2016-05-16 16:33:14	Response to a Mercury News article about an injury on our premiseshttps://t.co/3BFgV6Hfia
2415	732066441554362368	Elon Musk	2016-05-16 04:33:35	@margotroosevelt Only heard about this today. Sounds like the wrong thing happened on many levels. Will investigate and make it right.
2416	732042627445460992	Elon Musk	2016-05-16 02:58:57	@bittdk Better. Not there yet, but a solution is likely.
2417	732041468085342210	Elon Musk	2016-05-16 02:54:21	@4kpixelsyt yes
2418	732040492607643652	Elon Musk	2016-05-16 02:50:28	@mmustapic yup
2419	731984739012251648	Elon Musk	2016-05-15 23:08:56	Most recent rocket took max damage, due to v high entry velocity. Will be our life leader for ground tests to confirm others are good.

2427	730595677936324608	Elon Musk	2016-05-12 03:09:18	Ok https://t.co/jJJR28UGrK
2428	730592699011604481	Elon Musk	2016-05-12 02:57:27	Full credit to the team that's doing this. All happening without any help from me.  https://t.co/FAZE01lleA
2429	729850448832659457	Elon Musk	2016-05-10 01:48:01	@vicentes @TeslaMotors @Tim_Stevens @CNET coming soon
2430	728808794910662656	Elon Musk	2016-05-07 04:48:51	@tzepr Certainly agree that it is first and foremost a triumph for humanity. The cheering is in good spirit.
2431	728754091644440576	Elon Musk	2016-05-07 01:11:29	@LifeOfRockstar I think so
2432	728753234811060224	Elon Musk	2016-05-07 01:08:05	@lukealization Max is just 3X Merlin thrust and min is ~40% of 1 Merlin. Two outer engines shut off before the center does.
2433	728748075930386432	Elon Musk	2016-05-07 00:47:35	I love you too!https://t.co/Cnmd7cONU3

2435	728514673084014593	Elon Musk	2016-05-06 09:20:07	@hansmikael @TeslaMotors Thank goodness all are ok
2436	728462267893698561	Elon Musk	2016-05-06 05:51:53	Yeah, this was a three engine landing burn, so triple deceleration of last flight. That's important to minimize gravity losses.
2437	728459808270000128	Elon Musk	2016-05-06 05:42:07	May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar
2438	728457279943495681	Elon Musk	2016-05-06 05:32:04	Woohoo!! https://t.co/0P8n8VmFbr
2439	728444313248489472	Elon Musk	2016-05-06 04:40:32	Rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time, so odds of making it are maybe even, but we should learn a lot either way
2440	728327602440536064	Elon Musk	2016-05-05 20:56:46	Tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible, but I'd recommend ordering a Model 3 soon if you want 2018 delivery
2441	728126194244190208	Elon Musk	2016-05-05 07:36:27	@samsamlee777 yes
2442	727189428142235648	Elon Musk	2016-05-02 17:34:04	Filtering particulates from air makes a significant &amp; measurable diff to health. Wd like to credit Larry Page with turning me on to this.
2443	727176162997313536	Elon Musk	2016-05-02 16:41:22	Bioweapon Defense Mode is real https://t.co/xGNLrOyhaQ This is what happens when you turn it on: https://t.co/LnkHzXTxqN
2444	726919920374554625	Elon Musk	2016-05-01 23:43:09	@MacTechGenius @SacEV Have been reviewing end of line production quality personally. Slowed things down temporarily, but it's for the best.
2445	726878573001216000	Elon Musk	2016-05-01 20:58:51	@JohanMancus Historical precedent. Mars vehicle will be metric.
2446	726878466382041089	Elon Musk	2016-05-01 20:58:25	@SacEV next month (with a lot of other good stuff)
2447	726829989119696896	Elon Musk	2016-05-01 17:45:47	@scottymeuk @DericLew @SpaceflightIns @phillipcjackson exactly
2448	726820238361120768	Elon Musk	2016-05-01 17:07:03	@_andyoneal sides def, center maybe
2449	726812607298998272	Elon Musk	2016-05-01 16:36:43	@CyberdineX naturally
2450	726651603906785285	Elon Musk	2016-05-01 05:56:57	Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff --  twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
2451	726650591359819776	Elon Musk	2016-05-01 05:52:56	F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
2452	726579536410734592	Elon Musk	2016-05-01 01:10:35	@elonmusk F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be 22,800 kg
2453	726561442636263425	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 23:58:41	@lukealization No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers.
2454	726560848177561600	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 23:56:19	@lukealization No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
2455	726559990480150528	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 23:52:55	@elonmusk Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.
2456	726559284306173952	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 23:50:06	@mattyteare Basically current, but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce 3 sigma reserve margin.
2457	726557903205756928	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 23:44:37	Just posted latest max payload capabilities of Falcon 9 and Heavy https://t.co/Z45Y5V7G91

2461	726217758229168129	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 01:13:00	@vicentes @gdoehne yes, several times
2462	726217505560121344	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 01:12:00	@jbdeck for sure :)
2463	726217179683655680	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 01:10:42	@Tweetermeyer things like this should be purged shortly
2464	726216836069515264	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 01:09:20	@RokBottomGamers 100+ for almost everything 10+ for heat shields and a few other items.
2465	726215924760485888	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 01:05:43	@VivekMGeorge Zuck doesn't (yet) have a deep tech understanding of AI. I spend hours every week being educated by world's best researchers.
2466	726214236368576512	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 00:59:01	@gdoehne JCSat is pushing the envelope as a very hot and fast mission, so will land on the droneship. Next land landing in a few months.
2467	726213728278962176	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 00:56:59	@MrBoylan System scan detected only 0.2% of orders with same email and physical address. Those have been purged.
2468	726210827699806208	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 00:45:28	@vigneshraju of course
2469	726210366766632960	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 00:43:38	@maya_kazan Temporary spike in some areas due to X 3rd row seat recall. Should be sorted by June.
2470	726183794215022592	Elon Musk	2016-04-29 22:58:03	@MrBoylan Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of 2 will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are 2, so speculation unlikely.
2471	726127265612881920	Elon Musk	2016-04-29 19:13:25	@erothenberg Simple answer is that there just aren't many used Teslas available. Demand &gt;&gt; supply.
2472	726125524091723777	Elon Musk	2016-04-29 19:06:30	@erothenberg checking into it ...
2473	725367703045730304	Elon Musk	2016-04-27 16:55:11	@romn8tr will definitely do so
2474	725366265322172416	Elon Musk	2016-04-27 16:49:28	@abraham_cavazos some places are trickier than others, but yes. That's the value of having a PICA-3 heat shield with propulsive landing.
2475	725365829479460864	Elon Musk	2016-04-27 16:47:45	@Cardoso It could land on Venus no problem, but would last maybe a few hours. Tough local environment.
2476	725365200098988032	Elon Musk	2016-04-27 16:45:14	But wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV.
2477	725364699303301120	Elon Musk	2016-04-27 16:43:15	Dragon 2 is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system. Red Dragon Mars mission is the first test flight.
2478	724160269480431620	Elon Musk	2016-04-24 08:57:17	@KristianNairn A 3 should be workable, but an S or particularly an X would be better
2479	722893014507491329	Elon Musk	2016-04-20 21:01:40	@scottmcnealy That article was incredibly misleading and you should know it. Wager right now that Sun has received far more than Tesla?

2497	718598132888702976	Elon Musk	2016-04-09 00:35:20	Just wanted to write a note of appreciation for all those who have supported Tesla, SpaceX &amp; SolarCity over the years. Thank you.
2498	718580558180261888	Elon Musk	2016-04-08 23:25:30	@POTUS Thanks on behalf of an amazing team at SpaceX!
2499	718571641949650944	Elon Musk	2016-04-08 22:50:04	@Jon_Favreau @SpaceX Thanks!
2500	718548224441774082	Elon Musk	2016-04-08 21:17:01	@NASA @sgvcrime @SpaceX @Space_Station Thanks for your support! Looking forward to delivering the goods for you.

2502	718522065322532865	Elon Musk	2016-04-08 19:33:04	@arstechnica Reasons for ocean landing are technical, not economic. Orbit requires extreme horizontal velocity. Getting to space needs none.
2503	718272034166480896	Elon Musk	2016-04-08 02:59:32	SolarCity panels produce enough zero carbon energy to charge entire Tesla fleet https://t.co/bn4LRzii1V
2504	718232099145310208	Elon Musk	2016-04-08 00:20:51	@nonesuchzach Nickel is also in nickels
2505	718121595101782016	Elon Musk	2016-04-07 17:01:44	@nonesuchzach Battery uses no rare Earth metals. Main ingredient is nickel, which is what's used to coat cutlery, so very non-toxic.
2506	718112326889529344	Elon Musk	2016-04-07 16:24:55	Over 325k cars or ~$14B in preorders in first week. Only 5% ordered max of two, suggesting low levels of speculation.
2507	717755945003028480	Elon Musk	2016-04-06 16:48:47	@samboykin @danahull the only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid
2508	717755302863441920	Elon Musk	2016-04-06 16:46:14	@jpfrappier yes, will go all the way to Alaska
2509	717749079707484160	Elon Musk	2016-04-06 16:21:30	@Recode Dex will do comms, but my speeches are just a conversation w the audience. No time to rehearse &amp; don't want to read from a prompter.
2510	717746816503062528	Elon Musk	2016-04-06 16:12:30	@maximumblue we will
2511	717738859379843073	Elon Musk	2016-04-06 15:40:53	@LaurenShearer1 Doesn't sound right. Will check into it.
2512	717612929214849024	Elon Musk	2016-04-06 07:20:29	@MThorpXXi We are working on enlarging the opening. Aperture will be big enough for almost anything.
2513	717488049848889345	Elon Musk	2016-04-05 23:04:16	Most telling is that the SpaceX Propulsion CTO switched from driving a Porsche 911 Turbo S to a Model X
2514	717486314417827841	Elon Musk	2016-04-05 22:57:22	Model X reviewhttps://t.co/IS2zBgDlqn
2515	717414130836058113	Elon Musk	2016-04-05 18:10:32	@Brianmrtz probably unwise
2516	717039506965270529	Elon Musk	2016-04-04 17:21:55	@Christiano92 @Inspron @Jerry22499879 won't be a hatchback, but we should be able to increase the opening width and height
2517	717027400979058690	Elon Musk	2016-04-04 16:33:48	@stevehurd yes

2520	716786765290340352	Elon Musk	2016-04-04 00:37:36	@GoesAzedo yes
2521	716780724255260673	Elon Musk	2016-04-04 00:13:36	@morganpage sounds good
2522	716780425939521538	Elon Musk	2016-04-04 00:12:25	Signing off from impromptu Twitter AMA. Thanks for the suggestions. Btw, we really will have more cow bells.
2523	716778890744598528	Elon Musk	2016-04-04 00:06:19	@lordsshrivas Coming soon for all Tesla cars. Just an OTA software update.
2524	716769426675220481	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 23:28:42	@GonzaloBolio yes, coming this year
2525	716752643595583490	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 22:22:01	@AmarnathRevanna Air suspension dynamically adjusts ride height
2526	716751456574025728	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 22:17:18	@GatorWass you can do that now with S and X. Will be same for 3.
2527	716751300063531008	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 22:16:41	@_elombardo @rjpryan correct
2528	716751152906440705	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 22:16:06	@EduardoForneck hopefully 0.21
2529	716750603813318660	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 22:13:55	@PeteEhmKay @gerardomarina what's the link to that?
2530	716750313471025152	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 22:12:45	@tapwin No, but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity.
2531	716749717795946496	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 22:10:23	@mpatfield no problem
2532	716749159324377089	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 22:08:10	@CrackedUpCorson Will cover whole country hopefully this year
2533	716748255242100736	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 22:04:35	@AndersRytter yes, but production AWD will be a lot faster
2534	716747844175142912	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 22:02:57	@AlexBelohlavek less
2535	716747672477151232	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 22:02:16	@torvos torque is shifted between front &amp; rear motors every ~.01 secs. Traction control is way better than a normal AWD. Digital vs analog.
2536	716745898202685441	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 21:55:13	And, of course, it will have more cowbells.
2537	716745282394976257	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 21:52:46	Model 3 will be RWD, with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain.
2538	716743909750218752	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 21:47:19	@GolfsHard yes
2539	716743848580497409	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 21:47:04	@Zooropa88 @TeslaMotors Superchargers and service centers will cover all of Italy later this year
2540	716743321624903680	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 21:44:58	@_Only_Hawk @MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter definitely
2541	716742777468555264	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 21:42:49	@Alandbru @TeslaMotors should be addressed this year
2542	716731407310196736	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 20:57:38	@CmaxVs Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.
2543	716730641585340416	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 20:54:35	@iKrivetko that's not the real steering system
2544	716730009394647040	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 20:52:05	@B_Rans yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
2545	716729841362407424	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 20:51:25	@gerardomarina Some tweaking underway
2546	716729420078133248	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 20:49:44	@HBL_Cosmin Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3. It feels like a spaceship.
2547	716715017781915648	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 19:52:30	@MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
2548	716714416801099782	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 19:50:07	@scottkelley99 Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.
2549	716713492389044224	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 19:46:27	@_amwolo_ They can. Will be great for road trips and camping
2550	716713294128500737	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 19:45:39	@BValvsRacing It will make sense after part 2 of the Model 3 unveil
2551	716713023960784897	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 19:44:35	A Model 3 order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally.
2552	716710938406047744	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 19:36:18	In general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome
2553	716709914911989760	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 19:32:14	@RyanCasburn We always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter. Loyalty begets loyalty.
2554	716708661024804866	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 19:27:15	@SnoozeThroughF1 There will be an optional tow hitch.
2555	716704636896284673	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 19:11:15	@RGspan Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non X/S customers to receive the credit.
2556	716701798002610176	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 18:59:58	@jeffrey @neutyp Matte black was surprisingly popular. Probably makes sense to bring it to production.
2557	716700979379372032	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 18:56:43	@WaltNew cool, thanks!
2558	716696932073152512	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 18:40:38	@mindthreat @RyanHummer Yes, if the trend continues, before
2559	716693951260938241	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 18:28:48	276k Model 3 orders by end of Sat

2561	716356456593756160	Elon Musk	2016-04-02 20:07:43	@grebakshay We are working on an exact date, but Tesla will be in India before 3 production starts.
2562	716356220156686336	Elon Musk	2016-04-02 20:06:46	@Model3Owners They will. We spent a lot of time on those.
2563	716347450148040704	Elon Musk	2016-04-02 19:31:55	@vicentes Roadster, S and X customers are the ones who got us here and are paying for 3. They deserve a lot of credit.
2564	716347036786757632	Elon Musk	2016-04-02 19:30:17	@Aakashhh_ we will send something to everyone who ordered, but an extra gift for those who stood in some crazy long lines
2565	716346618035830784	Elon Musk	2016-04-02 19:28:37	@raytech247 yes, within a region. Can't deliver to all regions simultaneously. Too much complexity.
2566	716346279391944704	Elon Musk	2016-04-02 19:27:16	@squallcraft and a few other things
2567	716345597712670720	Elon Musk	2016-04-02 19:24:34	Token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via mail. Thought maybe 20-30 people per store would line up, not 800. Gifts on order.
2568	716344348107878401	Elon Musk	2016-04-02 19:19:36	@34thrain Maybe 1/4 to 1/2 of what happened. No one at Tesla thought it would be this high before part 2 of the unveil.
2569	716343274730991616	Elon Musk	2016-04-02 19:15:20	Will give an update tonight for the 3 day total, then last one on Wed for the full week. All efforts focused on accelerating the ramp.
2570	716341849409998849	Elon Musk	2016-04-02 19:09:40	253k as of 7am this morning
2571	716155418800730113	Elon Musk	2016-04-02 06:48:52	@sundarpichai thanks!
2572	716089404985487361	Elon Musk	2016-04-02 02:26:33	Now 232k orders
2573	715999819437850624	Elon Musk	2016-04-01 20:30:34	@GrahamABlair of course :)
2574	715975692228243460	Elon Musk	2016-04-01 18:54:41	@Jbourquee Giga is designed to self-power via solar panels (primarily), wind &amp; geo, using its own batteries to store electricity at night.
2575	715974749982220288	Elon Musk	2016-04-01 18:50:57	@steveagee def on the cards for the future
2576	715972980556193792	Elon Musk	2016-04-01 18:43:55	@JackLipstone should be within a week or two max
2577	715971547475886083	Elon Musk	2016-04-01 18:38:13	@Alyssa_Milano Hi Alyssa, thanks for placing your faith in Tesla. I hope you have a great experience with the car.
2578	715955186175459332	Elon Musk	2016-04-01 17:33:12	Definitely going to need to rethink production planning...
2579	715952781895426048	Elon Musk	2016-04-01 17:23:39	Thought it would slow way down today, but Model 3 order count is now at 198k. Recommend ordering soon, as the wait time is growing rapidly.
2580	715934657720639488	Elon Musk	2016-04-01 16:11:38	Model 3 orders at 180,000 in 24 hours. Selling price w avg option mix prob $42k, so ~$7.5B in a day. Future of electric cars looking bright!
2581	715776577485807621	Elon Musk	2016-04-01 05:43:29	@IndiaToday Will include India-wide Supercharger network
2582	715774770013409281	Elon Musk	2016-04-01 05:36:18	@Oatmeal sure!

2591	715647321019551744	Elon Musk	2016-03-31 21:09:52	Adding several more countries to Model 3 order page tonight. Check for details, but will include India, Brazil, SA, SK, NZ, Sing &amp; Ireland.
2592	715640777578143744	Elon Musk	2016-03-31 20:43:51	Model 3 orders, whether in store or online, are limited to two per person
2593	715637755598901248	Elon Musk	2016-03-31 20:31:51	Online ordering at https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr will now open at 7:30pm Pacific to ensure no server overload. Presentation still at 8:30.
2594	715574515405692929	Elon Musk	2016-03-31 16:20:33	@haerone From almost anywhere

2596	715566236822671360	Elon Musk	2016-03-31 15:47:40	Incredibly inspired by the interest in Model 3. You won't be disappointed. Also, small token of appreciation coming for those who lined up.
2597	715433418260029440	Elon Musk	2016-03-31 06:59:53	Model 3 unveil will be webcast live at 8:30pm California time at https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr
2598	715309739752747009	Elon Musk	2016-03-30 22:48:26	@rossbin You will see the car very clearly, but some important elements will be added and some will evolve.
2599	715307847890903041	Elon Musk	2016-03-30 22:40:55	Tomorrow is Part 1 of the Model 3 unveil. Part 2, which takes things to another level, will be closer to production.
2600	715303533659041792	Elon Musk	2016-03-30 22:23:46	Model 3 order day starting in Australia https://t.co/T6aUnG5BCv
2601	715220713326530561	Elon Musk	2016-03-30 16:54:40	You can now buy cruise ship tickets for the Arctic passage. Seeing is believing. https://t.co/LhKupkNMFC
2602	715219872204992512	Elon Musk	2016-03-30 16:51:20	Great article by @BadAstronomer. Important to note max temp record. Too much attention on avg temp. Max matters most https://t.co/0FnIAVsbIu
2603	714963420316049411	Elon Musk	2016-03-29 23:52:17	Looks like we may need to increase production plans for the Model 3 https://t.co/fmCPFC9FEm

2609	707632249340952577	Elon Musk	2016-03-09 18:20:50	The AEI meeting wasn't secret and I was only there for a few hours to talk about Mars and sustainable energy. Nothing to do with Trump.
2610	707611375191744512	Elon Musk	2016-03-09 16:57:53	Congrats to DeepMind! Many experts in the field thought AI was 10 years away from achieving this. https://t.co/5gGZZkud3K

2612	706610504161107968	Elon Musk	2016-03-06 22:40:47	SpaceX and Tesla rated most meaningful work in high tech. Also, most stressful, but that goes with the territory.  https://t.co/y8s4UdMF5z

2622	704770247769722880	Elon Musk	2016-03-01 20:48:15	Pushing launch to Friday due to extreme high altitude wind shear. Hits like a sledgehammer when going up supersonic https://t.co/Gr8T5upaLd
2623	704603669786791936	Elon Musk	2016-03-01 09:46:20	@PernilleT Only heard about it today. Doesn't sound like they are in the right though in their dealings with our subcontractor.
2624	704102461766676481	Elon Musk	2016-02-29 00:34:43	@SpaceX Launch aborted on low thrust alarm. Rising oxygen temps due to hold for boat and helium bubble triggered alarm.
2625	704092857829732353	Elon Musk	2016-02-28 23:56:33	@SpaceX AF has placed launch on hold due to a boat entering the edge of the keep out zone. Scrambling helo to get them to move.
2626	703760056827912197	Elon Musk	2016-02-28 01:54:07	@TLKFremont Great leg room for 3rd row, rear visibility better, easy storage of long cargo.

2628	703650455407079424	Elon Musk	2016-02-27 18:38:36	@skiesforme Can't emphasize enough that white is the best interior. Also, pick 6 seats unless you really need 7.
2629	703636763227484161	Elon Musk	2016-02-27 17:44:11	@skiesforme @TeslaMotors That said, the white interior is the best. Highly recommend.
2630	703636644704849921	Elon Musk	2016-02-27 17:43:43	@skiesforme Heavy use of the white causes splitting. Adding backing material to strengthen. Will be upgraded at no cost.

2661	689299216607232000	Elon Musk	2016-01-19 04:11:54	My best guess for 2016: ~70% landing success rate (so still a few more RUDs to go), then hopefully improving to ~90% in 2017

2664	688846973361721345	Elon Musk	2016-01-17 22:14:51	@stunt_penguin @LayOn_OverWhale Stage 1 would reach low Earth orbit if not hefting a second stage, but payload would be greatly reduced.
2665	688846557949472768	Elon Musk	2016-01-17 22:13:12	@JimmyVosika Actually, didn't get environmental approval in time, but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed.
2666	688845689023901696	Elon Musk	2016-01-17 22:09:45	If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h.
2667	688844190826942465	Elon Musk	2016-01-17 22:03:47	Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
2668	688842435955261440	Elon Musk	2016-01-17 21:56:49	As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed.

2671	688816810754359297	Elon Musk	2016-01-17 20:14:59	@Uncle_Gus probably
2672	688816554306191360	Elon Musk	2016-01-17 20:13:58	However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing.
2673	688814634489413632	Elon Musk	2016-01-17 20:06:21	Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating.
2674	688175650570547202	Elon Musk	2016-01-16 01:47:15	Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.

2723	669131093379956736	Elon Musk	2015-11-24 12:30:59	Getting to space needs ~Mach 3, but GTO orbit requires ~Mach 30. The energy needed is the square, i.e. 9 units for space and 900 for orbit.
2724	669129655597731841	Elon Musk	2015-11-24 12:25:16	"It is, however, important to clear up the difference between ""space"" and ""orbit"", as described well by https://t.co/7PD42m37fZ"
2725	669129347555430400	Elon Musk	2015-11-24 12:24:02	Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO team for achieving VTOL on their booster
2726	667537317037404160	Elon Musk	2015-11-20 02:57:53	"@levie Sounds perfect, you had me at ""enterprise""."
2727	667536629830017024	Elon Musk	2015-11-20 02:55:09	@StartupLJackson Yeah and hell yeah
2728	667519604537724928	Elon Musk	2015-11-20 01:47:30	@atduarte From anywhere
2729	667519445414252544	Elon Musk	2015-11-20 01:46:52	Should mention that I will be interviewing people personally and Autopilot reports directly to me. This is a super high priority.
2730	667517215390863360	Elon Musk	2015-11-20 01:38:00	We are looking for hardcore software engineers. No prior experience with cars required. Please include code sample or link to your work.
2731	667516705116065792	Elon Musk	2015-11-20 01:35:59	Ramping up the Autopilot software team at Tesla to achieve generalized full autonomy. If interested, contact autopilot@teslamotors.com.
2732	663290006992236544	Elon Musk	2015-11-08 09:40:35	@drew definitely aliens!
2733	662039125898334209	Elon Musk	2015-11-04 22:50:02	@kevinmitnick Current production is LTE. Can be upgraded by service.
2734	661293692410445824	Elon Musk	2015-11-02 21:27:57	@BjornNyland @TeslaMotors well done!
2735	660693896553324545	Elon Musk	2015-11-01 05:44:34	@ID_AA_Carmack noted
2736	660117630175412224	Elon Musk	2015-10-30 15:34:42	@GertAbildskov Wow, that's great!
2737	659543458953101312	Elon Musk	2015-10-29 01:33:08	Model S Ludicrous Mode achieves 2.6 sec 0-60 mph and 10.9 sec 1/4 mile in Motor Trend test https://t.co/IpgTF6s9M8
2738	659541500712251392	Elon Musk	2015-10-29 01:25:22	@MacTechGenius yes, comes with each car
2739	658842380922023936	Elon Musk	2015-10-27 03:07:18	Compliment from Jeffrey is much appreciated, but the people of Tesla deserve all the credit
2740	658780657103978496	Elon Musk	2015-10-26 23:02:02	I should clarify that https://t.co/iUX7wkMxY8 is an independent website. We don't have any control over the content.
2741	658735748498100225	Elon Musk	2015-10-26 20:03:35	Cool! https://t.co/HOe0K7qkuk
2742	658657239331270656	Elon Musk	2015-10-26 14:51:37	@anakinSGE Hopefully, mid to late next year. We are being more cautious abt expanding countries to ensure a great user experience each time.
2743	658358794292891648	Elon Musk	2015-10-25 19:05:42	@GangsOfGtown Given high local demand, a Gigafactory in India would probably make sense in the long term.
2744	658358303454420992	Elon Musk	2015-10-25 19:03:45	@abrax4s Yes, establishing charging and service infrastructure in Mexico now. Official launch in next several months.
2745	658357909265362944	Elon Musk	2015-10-25 19:02:11	@javashri Auto import duties are prohibitively high. Hoping for a special category for EVs. Most of our discussion was about batteries.
2746	658357058106822656	Elon Musk	2015-10-25 18:58:48	@roneijlander We just finished building a huge expansion in Tilburg!
2747	658356679793205248	Elon Musk	2015-10-25 18:57:18	These are all things I've said before and are naturally needed to improve in-market affordability, so no real news here.
2748	658356079026270208	Elon Musk	2015-10-25 18:54:55	Model 3 is due in ~2 yrs. A China factory for local demand cd be as soon as a year after. A factory in Europe wd happen for same reason.
2749	658354915824173056	Elon Musk	2015-10-25 18:50:18	My comments in China weren't transcribed correctly. Tesla will keep making cars &amp; batteries in CA &amp; NV as far into future as I can imagine.
2750	657704144267059200	Elon Musk	2015-10-23 23:44:22	@JessicaTetreau important to set AC to not recirc (air exits thru rear) and use the snap in shade, which Tesla service can provide
2751	657702829398822912	Elon Musk	2015-10-23 23:39:08	@shanenickerson Amount of change needed is enormous - like a spinal cord transplant. Would cost less and work better with a new car.
2752	657686500310700032	Elon Musk	2015-10-23 22:34:15	Autopilot 1.01 coming soon: curve speed adaption, controller smoothness, better lane holding on poor roads, improved fleet learning!
2753	657685372579745793	Elon Musk	2015-10-23 22:29:46	Regulatory approvals received, so Autopilot rolling out to all countries! (Excluding Japan, which is still under review)
2754	657141296050606080	Elon Musk	2015-10-22 10:27:48	@JarkkoKuoppala all
2755	657110887707361280	Elon Musk	2015-10-22 08:26:58	@backseatdiver Hoping for Friday release
2756	657106581893574656	Elon Musk	2015-10-22 08:09:52	@elonmusk Good feedback. Will write up a list of software priorities in the coming weeks.
2757	656973991379378176	Elon Musk	2015-10-21 23:23:00	What esthetic and functionality improvements would you like to see in the 7.1 UI overhaul? Or new features entirely?
2758	656973325172920320	Elon Musk	2015-10-21 23:20:21	@sAlmaneei already in Jordan. Rest of states in region next year.
2759	656973144306094080	Elon Musk	2015-10-21 23:19:38	@bonnienorman thanks Bonnie :)
2760	656972712649359360	Elon Musk	2015-10-21 23:17:55	@M4XRodri planning to have a big opening in Mexico City soon and then proceed gradually to central and South America.
2761	656972435401678848	Elon Musk	2015-10-21 23:16:49	@octomagon me too:
2762	656972046639984644	Elon Musk	2015-10-21 23:15:16	@jonthomason yay! Always happy to make others happy
2763	656971866163277825	Elon Musk	2015-10-21 23:14:33	@thebradholt big UI update coming in V7.1
2764	656971573337944065	Elon Musk	2015-10-21 23:13:23	@ryybuzz we won't be, but yes
2765	656970996801474560	Elon Musk	2015-10-21 23:11:06	Tesla gets top rating of any company in service. Most important, CR says 97% of owners expect their next car to be a Tesla (the acid test).
2766	656970117721534464	Elon Musk	2015-10-21 23:07:36	Consumer Reports reliability survey includes a lot of early production cars. Already addressed in new cars.
