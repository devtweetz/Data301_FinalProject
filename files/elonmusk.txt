836442868180905984	Elon Musk	2017-02-28 05:08:14	@jamesatbuzz This is not true. TM works for a lot of people and that's great, but I've maybe done it 7 or 8 times ever.
836328719165763584	Elon Musk	2017-02-27 21:34:39	Fly me to the moon ... Okhttps://t.co/6QT8m5SHwn
836020571490021376	Elon Musk	2017-02-27 01:10:11	SpaceX announcement tomorrow at 1pm PST
835361919775100929	Elon Musk	2017-02-25 05:32:56	@MacTechGenius of course
835351081945350145	Elon Musk	2017-02-25 04:49:52	@DueDiamond maybe one of those too
835350234049863680	Elon Musk	2017-02-25 04:46:30	Roller coasters are awesome
835202594968477696	Elon Musk	2017-02-24 18:59:50	@johnpaulbrewer Something on a tristate border might work. Gigafactory plus nearby supporting supply chain needs a very large workforce.
835187859158020097	Elon Musk	2017-02-24 18:01:17	@donbarbieri @GreenCarReports Good chance it will
835187686151315456	Elon Musk	2017-02-24 18:00:36	@davidshepardson @BW @ATT @ToysRUs Exactly :)
835185478512992256	Elon Musk	2017-02-24 17:51:49	@meganmurp @ChrisFaile @BW I didn't pose for it (hopefully that's obvious) or want me on cover. Tunnel boring machine pic wd be way better
835178020604301313	Elon Musk	2017-02-24 17:22:11	@adrianvolts Minor improvements update this weekend. High speed autosteer in about two weeks.
834740218531962881	Elon Musk	2017-02-23 12:22:31	Excellent Tesla Model X review https://t.co/wvog4Pbo1o
833411017065394176	Elon Musk	2017-02-19 20:20:45	Just posted a video https://t.co/RCV7MVi8rs

833332058453790720	Elon Musk	2017-02-19 15:06:59	Baby came back https://t.co/5FRhw3AT2b
833329896168370179	Elon Musk	2017-02-19 14:58:24	@mattnewby no
832995083519614976	Elon Musk	2017-02-18 16:47:58	@Xuan_Thai System was green for launch. I called it off.
832992529872097280	Elon Musk	2017-02-18 16:37:50	@spacecom They are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much R&amp;D risk on Dragon 2, that I feel very confident of 2018.
832986598627106818	Elon Musk	2017-02-18 16:14:15	@zperrin99 Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed
832984361989386240	Elon Musk	2017-02-18 16:05:22	Btw, 99% likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that 1% chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day.
832979955092819968	Elon Musk	2017-02-18 15:47:51	@Zybbby Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question
832973218348625920	Elon Musk	2017-02-18 15:21:05	If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause
832970849791537152	Elon Musk	2017-02-18 15:11:41	All systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate.
832871068066942976	Elon Musk	2017-02-18 08:35:11	Counting down to the first SpaceX launch from the Apollo 11 launch pad tomorrow morning (webcast‚Ä¶ https://t.co/upjTcmftte
832868838479851521	Elon Musk	2017-02-18 08:26:19	spacex's photo https://t.co/ImEDAut3nI
832863988836814848	Elon Musk	2017-02-18 08:07:03	Provided Dragon 2 demo missions go well, SpaceX is highly confident of being able to fly US astronauts in 2018 https://t.co/usUto6QSi7
832788691588296705	Elon Musk	2017-02-18 03:07:51	Looks like we are go for launch. Added an abort trigger at T-60 secs for pressure decay of upper stage helium spin start system.
832647116816150530	Elon Musk	2017-02-17 17:45:17	Investigating a (very small) leak in the upper stage. If ok, will launch tomorrow. https://t.co/bQf97lywn4
832619549937668096	Elon Musk	2017-02-17 15:55:44	@emenietti @chafkin Yes, but only deep in solid rock, where the walls are self-supporting and concrete reinforcements arguably aren't needed
832480331496185857	Elon Musk	2017-02-17 06:42:32	@sc00bs It's much easier to do the CGI that way
832375525754626048	Elon Musk	2017-02-16 23:46:04	Daylight rocket launch &amp; landing at the Cape this weekend. Will be the 1st SpaceX flight from the Apollo launch pad. https://t.co/Vr5LQjYaPZ
832089102266687488	Elon Musk	2017-02-16 04:47:56	@PhoebeColeman I used that one :)
832086901704126464	Elon Musk	2017-02-16 04:39:11	Ok, what are some good ones? Will have to meter these out. Hopefully, kids can't die from groaning too much.
832086234302341120	Elon Musk	2017-02-16 04:36:32	@VRGTech @Floydilicious They are doing India proud
832085891715723264	Elon Musk	2017-02-16 04:35:10	@osiris26 You may come to regret that request :)
832085554619572225	Elon Musk	2017-02-16 04:33:50	@LittleDovah Yeah, exactly. So that makes it cool, right!?
832084918645596166	Elon Musk	2017-02-16 04:31:18	@Floydilicious Yeah, awesome achievement by ISRO. Very impressive!
832084402473627650	Elon Musk	2017-02-16 04:29:15	Apparently, there is this thing called "Dad jokes" and I make them
832082377920778240	Elon Musk	2017-02-16 04:21:12	@LudwigMorelos You're right, I can't hide any more! I am Irony Man...
831972894355828736	Elon Musk	2017-02-15 21:06:09	@Samcornwell they were earlier drafts that I accidentally published. I said the same thing a week already.
831972613912080384	Elon Musk	2017-02-15 21:05:03	In appreciation, Tesla is providing all repair costs free of charge and expedited. https://t.co/D68HNJcCoQ
831969536584806400	Elon Musk	2017-02-15 20:52:49	Congrats to the Tesla owner who sacrificed damage to his own car to bring a car with an unconscious driver safely to a stop!
831692803210096641	Elon Musk	2017-02-15 02:33:11	@lollieshopMOM Best place to watch is on the Cape causeway
830239445433544704	Elon Musk	2017-02-11 02:18:03	@SEACityLight @Nas2four Sounds like the Tesla Powerwall (consumer) and Powerpack (utility/commercial) might be useful
830148763578662916	Elon Musk	2017-02-10 20:17:43	Falcon 9 rocket now vertical at Cape Canaveral on launch complex 39-A. This is the same launch‚Ä¶ https://t.co/wY6dWRcer3
829885356531032064	Elon Musk	2017-02-10 02:51:02	@accohen @MeganGeuss @arstechnica Exactly. What this person said is untrue.
829861775357071361	Elon Musk	2017-02-10 01:17:19	@RusulAlrubail @MarkRuffalo @guardian Please check your facts. Tesla and SpaceX joined as soon as we received the filing, which was Monday.
829509777218613248	Elon Musk	2017-02-09 01:58:37	@dknisely of course it will
829447188325412866	Elon Musk	2017-02-08 21:49:54	@SundalJ Should all be uploaded by next month
829442592978792448	Elon Musk	2017-02-08 21:31:39	@sureal808 Motor Trend could only achieve 2.4 sec when they tested the Porsche 918
829441987686182912	Elon Musk	2017-02-08 21:29:14	@VoltzCoreAudio I don't know what make you think that's a rocket. It's completely covered in a tarpaulin...
829396254920568832	Elon Musk	2017-02-08 18:27:31	George Schultz and Jim Baker article in @WSJ regarding a carbon tax https://t.co/tf2Urgms85
829046669517860869	Elon Musk	2017-02-07 19:18:23	@BatlaG yes
829027848434257924	Elon Musk	2017-02-07 18:03:36	@goel_ishan Hoping for summer this year
829015254524792832	Elon Musk	2017-02-07 17:13:33	@mdcdave yes, altitude improves performance for electric. Opposite of combustion cars.
829002643947167744	Elon Musk	2017-02-07 16:23:27	@jovanik21 @Veidit No, will be lower. Wheelbase can't fit 100.
828999653886550018	Elon Musk	2017-02-07 16:11:34	@jovanik21 Also, Tesla service can remove front trunk liner if you don't use it and improve performance further
828998837578526723	Elon Musk	2017-02-07 16:08:19	@Veidit No plans to take X, S (or 3) above 100 kWh. Semi necessarily and pickup truck maybe will go above.
828984746029912064	Elon Musk	2017-02-07 15:12:19	@jovanik21 Take out the floor mats and its 2.27. MT said everything had to be standard production.
828983364543664128	Elon Musk	2017-02-07 15:06:50	@quick_pi yes
828981873086865410	Elon Musk	2017-02-07 15:00:54	Production Tesla Model S P100DL sets Motor Trend all-time world record to 60 mph in 2.27 sec https://t.co/sxALQrM5Ls
828320620463140865	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 19:13:20	Signing off now. That was more than enough Twitter trouble for one morning!
828315290782093312	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:52:09	@qriosity_ @MacTechGenius No rare earth metals in battery
828314791819218944	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:50:10	@camdtor @trylks Almost ready
828314321679704066	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:48:18	@MacTechGenius App update is about two weeks out. Linux kernel and browser update probably a month or so. HW2 Autopilot has priority.
828312660299091968	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:41:42	@FredericLambert Yes, but Model 3 is the overwhelming priority
828312511946567680	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:41:06	@clay_ellis I will post an article he wrote half a century ago about flying through Africa and Asia in his plane. One of my favorite things.
828309896122789889	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:30:43	@christesla @FredericLambert Almost there. We are just being very careful with the rollout.
828307625632813056	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:21:41	@trylks A lot of terrible things could happen in four years of extremism. Do you really want another war? That's where extremism leads.
828305244891336706	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:12:14	@FredericLambert Yeah, it is hard to convey complex ideas in 140 chars and tone is lost in text
828304178644656129	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:07:59	@CycleTrades @rtoro20 People should push to have as many moderates advising the President as possible. Blind hate is never the right answer.
828303494981550082	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:05:16	@Wise1919 @FredericLambert Rolling out a new update today.
828303126935568384	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:03:49	@recipher We should try our best
828302292520681474	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 18:00:30	@iamDeveloper Really? Ok, I will work harder on thinking first and tweeting second. Sorry for anything thoughtless.
828301829909921792	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:58:40	@martinengwicht @FredericLambert I just had three coffees :)
828301680596889600	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:58:04	@thelogicbox @IanrossWins Mars is critical for the long-term survival of humanity and life on Earth as we know it
828301040768393216	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:55:31	@seanbroswag @FredericLambert Numeric
828300568062021632	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:53:39	@B0Turner Gravimetric energy density of batteries and achieving a high cell mass fraction
828300245998116864	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:52:22	@Travelingmom23 I love Canada! I'm half Canadian. My Mom was born in Regina. My grandfather (her Dad) was American, born in Minnesota.
828299070154358784	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:47:42	@FredericLambert Me too. I hope to get back to regularly scheduled programming soon ...
828298780638400512	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:46:33	@brendangage I agree, great country! Looking forward to taking my kids for a visit. I've heard it is incredibly beautiful.
828297954314289153	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:43:15	@rtoro20 Really? I already have both feet in my mouth and am levitating on my own idiocy...
828297337353154560	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:40:48	@DaringKid True. Me being one of them :)
828297251026001924	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:40:28	@marcelsalathe Not perfect &amp; cd be better, but 10th out of 200+ countries with only a 0.08 diff to "1st" place means it's essentially on par
828294008677994496	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:27:35	@andresantoniop Fair point, sorry
828293735419109376	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:26:30	Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?
828292953798012932	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:23:23	@RealPhillipPoon Needs a major overhaul
828292305522192384	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:20:49	@BenCam137 @FifthRocket Exactly
828291884858691584	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:19:08	@AanstadGard Norway is great on all levels. Love Norway!
828291645548408833	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:18:11	@BullFlags Yeah. And Twitter is a hater Hellscape.
828291190965551106	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:16:23	@W4AS Good grief, I'm not "working" for Trump. I'm trying to provide advice that helps take things in a more positive direction.
828290224069419010	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:12:32	@BitterMercy @CallumK24 Actually, I think it's kinda cool :)
828289948767895552	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:11:27	@EricHaegler @iLexomat Isn't that basically like having a jury of peers? That is a default option in the US.
828289487075733504	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:09:37	@vladsavov Those countries have strong justice systems, but I'd put them roughly on par with US. That rating system conflates many factors.
828287608614744064	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:02:09	@FifthRocket Did you read my tweets? I attacked it hard. Did not defend.
828287354741936130	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 17:01:08	@KENEMONICS You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
828285894570422272	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 16:55:20	@martinengwicht Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.
828285409675341824	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 16:53:25	@paulvankeep Mostly anti-drug laws
828284802327523328	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 16:51:00	@zgiarrizzo Exactly
828284631170560000	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 16:50:19	@TheLAAdams The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law.
828284048103579651	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 16:48:00	@humplik The remedy for that is changing the law
828282768559849473	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 16:42:55	@CallumK24 Ok, but what's up the wigs?
828282648711802881	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 16:42:26	@iLexomat There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.
828281953455579136	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 16:39:41	@Biesseman True!
828280866451374085	Elon Musk	2017-02-05 16:35:21	Many in America don't realize how proud they should be of the legal system. Not perfect, but nowhere is the cause of justice better served.
828018446873006080	Elon Musk	2017-02-04 23:12:36	Walking down the street and saw this https://t.co/Mpv5j6088K
828004976228188160	Elon Musk	2017-02-04 22:19:04	@ChrisJCav Maybe my favorite mug ever
828004231101706241	Elon Musk	2017-02-04 22:16:06	@nintendomaniac @alext4627 I wish!
828002410811494400	Elon Musk	2017-02-04 22:08:52	@OldManRiver1800 Then so be it. I'd rather do what I believe is right, than do what appears right simply to avoid criticism.
828000753432293376	Elon Musk	2017-02-04 22:02:17	@bonnienorman @advandermeer Wow, cool!
828000589082742784	Elon Musk	2017-02-04 22:01:38	@alext4627 That's exactly what I thought. Love Half-Life.
827999209085403143	Elon Musk	2017-02-04 21:56:09	@ana_lontana Nuances are important :)
827983309359763456	Elon Musk	2017-02-04 20:52:58	Rainbows, unicorns and electric cars https://t.co/oGHkVUmpdi
827954983710650369	Elon Musk	2017-02-04 19:00:25	26 ft diameter tunnel running 2 miles under D.C. https://t.co/XFQkioEsg8
827928366711967745	Elon Musk	2017-02-04 17:14:39	@eveegdmann Really don't want to get in politics. I just want to help invent and develop technologies that improve lives. Feels so bizarre.
827926509197332484	Elon Musk	2017-02-04 17:07:16	@DanielleBloeme Yes, for now, but this should be addressed on all fronts: judicial, legislative and executive.
827925653022453760	Elon Musk	2017-02-04 17:03:52	In addition, I again raised climate. I believe this is doing good, so will remain on council &amp; keep at it. Doing otherwise would be wrong.
827924171661377536	Elon Musk	2017-02-04 16:57:59	At my request, the agenda for yesterday's White House meeting went from not mentioning the travel ban to having it be first and foremost

787797036699521024	Elon Musk	2016-10-16 23:27:04	Moving the Tesla announcement to Wednesday. Needs a few more days of refinement.

786601762354442242	Elon Musk	2016-10-13 16:17:29	@vicentes obviously wrong
785517307476922370	Elon Musk	2016-10-10 16:28:14	@Cocoanetics @heiseonline Not actually based on science. Objective data shows Autopilot is safer than manually driven cars.
785505765343625216	Elon Musk	2016-10-10 15:42:23	@saufkopf87 @FortuneMagazine Utter nonsense. Empirical evidence is what matters, not random speculation.
785495295652167680	Elon Musk	2016-10-10 15:00:46	@jovanik21 @arstechnica @drgitlin Sounds like a great move!
785494639029719040	Elon Musk	2016-10-10 14:58:10	Good for Germany! https://t.co/SMdOL9GcTl
785488210629537792	Elon Musk	2016-10-10 14:32:37	@hohocho That's why we need to accelerate solar power
785485969705140224	Elon Musk	2016-10-10 14:23:43	Real fraud going on is denial of climate science. As for "subsidies", Tesla gets pennies on dollar vs coal. How about we both go to zero?

785139055793152000	Elon Musk	2016-10-09 15:25:12	Would also like to correct expectations that Tesla/SolarCity will need to raise equity or corp debt in Q4. Won't be necessary for either.

785135480811712513	Elon Musk	2016-10-09 15:11:00	@FuncRandm I agree. Speed of light is a point in favor of the sim.

781208061994119168	Elon Musk	2016-09-28 19:04:50	@GoodDayM Something messed up here. Tesla policy is equal pricing for all. No discounts ever unless a car is a floor model or was damaged.

763043936889769984	Elon Musk	2016-08-09 16:07:05	@verge Yeah. Movie still enjoyable due to some great characters, but plot &amp; editing could've been better. Really needed more Joker+Harley.
762097903452102657	Elon Musk	2016-08-07 01:27:53	Sure feels weird to find myself defending the robots
760143143949987840	Elon Musk	2016-08-01 16:00:22	@ChristopherMori Never. There is no product rationale for doing so.
759798110470205440	Elon Musk	2016-07-31 17:09:20	@JamesRossi100 probably makes sense to build off the pickup truck chassis
759797091375906817	Elon Musk	2016-07-31 17:05:17	@RoadandTrack @TeslaMotors Model Y (compact SUV) off Model 3 chassis. Tesla Bus/Minibus/Spacebus off Model X.
759433196471656448	Elon Musk	2016-07-30 16:59:18	@tomschouteden @DMC_Ryan @voguemaster @Jalopnik good point
759425342792605696	Elon Musk	2016-07-30 16:28:05	@DMC_Ryan @voguemaster @Jalopnik I think we should be inconsistent in our naming conventions after Model Y

759153112993017856	Elon Musk	2016-07-29 22:26:21	Some good guessing by @Jalopnik. The Tesla Minibus will be built on a Model X chassis. People density potential is surprisingly high.

755167487017291776	Elon Musk	2016-07-18 22:28:53	Really tempting to redesign upper stage for return too (Falcon Heavy has enough power), but prob best to stay focused on the Mars rocket
755166100967550979	Elon Musk	2016-07-18 22:23:23	Can't wait to see all three cores of Falcon Heavy come back for landings! First two will be almost simultaneous. https://t.co/ryMiewZM4L

754858623357095936	Elon Musk	2016-07-18 02:01:35	@BilalNaseer Thanks. Exactly. Some in the press think they're so much smarter than Tesla owners that "they know better". Makes no sense.
754804233107562496	Elon Musk	2016-07-17 22:25:27	@MacTechGenius V8 will be our biggest release since v1, so taking longer to refine. Awesome on every level. Meeting w design team every day.
754801124755013633	Elon Musk	2016-07-17 22:13:06	Tesla customers are v smart &amp; don't want media speaking on their behalf abt Autopilot. Recent poll: 0.0% want it disabled -- not 0.1%, 0.0%.
754798592880156672	Elon Musk	2016-07-17 22:03:02	@heroineworshipe @BoschGlobal It can at moderate range, but our ultrasonics are very good at human (or anything &gt;= water density) detection
754793746483572736	Elon Musk	2016-07-17 21:43:47	@MacTechGenius Improved fan speed algorithm coming soon. Doesn't need to be so loud.
754786895343779840	Elon Musk	2016-07-17 21:16:33	Great rebuttal by a Tesla owner to those calling for Autopilot to be disabled. Was written with zero input from us. https://t.co/Kfg1ewKoCZ
754776743156805632	Elon Musk	2016-07-17 20:36:13	@Tyler_K_Berg That is a very good point!
754772663365664768	Elon Musk	2016-07-17 20:20:00	Have to focus on tonight's @SpaceX launch. Will post Tesla (master) product plan afterwards.
754772024657113088	Elon Musk	2016-07-17 20:17:28	Btw, want to thank both Bosch and MobilEye for their help and support in making Autopilot better. Please direct all criticism at Tesla.
754769913814941696	Elon Musk	2016-07-17 20:09:05	Promising call today with @BoschGlobal, maker of our radar sensor. Looks like significant improvements possible via OTA software update.
754687525034270720	Elon Musk	2016-07-17 14:41:42	@Mikey67Tang much appreciated
754687383308730368	Elon Musk	2016-07-17 14:41:08	@reddersla Usually true. We need more sane and reasonable people making their voice heard.

753843823546028040	Elon Musk	2016-07-15 06:49:07	Good thing about radar is that, unlike lidar (which is visible wavelength), it can see through rain, snow, fog and dust

752201456980078593	Elon Musk	2016-07-10 18:02:57	@bolayer @SwiftOnSecurity US is ~11 deaths per billion miles. WW is 17 deaths per billion. Autopilot already much better than either so far.
752199681166315521	Elon Musk	2016-07-10 17:55:53	@c4757p @SwiftOnSecurity Unless we get there and find it isn't enough. Just won't be before 1B.
752198648469917696	Elon Musk	2016-07-10 17:51:47	@FantaAIex It is extensively tested in the lab and in the Tesla test fleet. However, there is no substitute for real world experience.
752197971253485568	Elon Musk	2016-07-10 17:49:06	@SwiftOnSecurity With less than 1B miles, there simply isn't enough data. 1B is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition.
752196881871040512	Elon Musk	2016-07-10 17:44:46	@nicatronTg @SwiftOnSecurity Thanks. Point of calling it "beta" was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn't perfect.

752193726462586881	Elon Musk	2016-07-10 17:32:14	@vicentes Probably six months. Will include hundreds of refinements to handle rare corner cases in Autopilot.

752192639403896833	Elon Musk	2016-07-10 17:27:54	@chirag Use of word "beta" is explicitly so that drivers don't get comfortable. It is not beta software in the standard sense.

750838518524542980	Elon Musk	2016-07-06 23:47:07	@disinformatico @Eddy_Jahn cool, thanks :)
750837854021058560	Elon Musk	2016-07-06 23:44:28	@gdoehne @disinformatico @Eddy_Jahn The Google term of self-driving would probably be more appropriate then.
750837202398093312	Elon Musk	2016-07-06 23:41:53	@disinformatico @Eddy_Jahn In other words, the intended implication is that a driver must remain alert, just as a pilot must remain alert.
750836652109594626	Elon Musk	2016-07-06 23:39:42	@disinformatico @Eddy_Jahn Tesla Tesla Autopilot is named after aircraft autopilot, as it is always expected that a pilot must stay alert.
750835746613915648	Elon Musk	2016-07-06 23:36:06	@jacobrossi All publicly known Tesla product developments are called out, incl vehicles and batteries. Would be odd *not* to include.

750353176570789888	Elon Musk	2016-07-05 15:38:32	@samabuelsamid Wrong to exclude non-occupant deaths. Autopilot would have prevented this cyclist from being killed https://t.co/ic9liqnyDN
750351150382194688	Elon Musk	2016-07-05 15:30:29	@alansmurray If you care about auto deaths as material to stock prices, why no articles about 1M+/year deaths from other auto companies?
750350191044259840	Elon Musk	2016-07-05 15:26:41	@alansmurray Yes, it was material to you -- BS article increased your advertising revenue. Just wasn't material to TSLA, as shown by market.

744551674082136066	Elon Musk	2016-06-19 15:25:26	We *def* don't recommended this, but Model S floats well enough to turn it into a boat for short periods of time. Thrust via wheel rotation.
744549842496655360	Elon Musk	2016-06-19 15:18:10	Tesla owner drives through a flooded tunnel &amp; out the other side https://t.co/RmPxdZShhq
743603466631733248	Elon Musk	2016-06-17 00:37:36	As mentioned at the beginning of the year, I'm expecting ~70% success rate on landings for the year. 2016 is the year of experimentation.
743602894226653184	Elon Musk	2016-06-17 00:35:20	Looks like early liquid oxygen depletion caused engine shutdown just above the deck https://t.co/Sa6uCkpknY
743602229307805696	Elon Musk	2016-06-17 00:32:41	Turns out the landing was not as fast we thought, but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines
743600755739754497	Elon Musk	2016-06-17 00:26:50	@fucktyler Thanks Tyler
743102502225076227	Elon Musk	2016-06-15 15:26:57	Landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. Maybe hardest impact to date. Droneship still ok.
743099301174247424	Elon Musk	2016-06-15 15:14:14	Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.
743098357728444418	Elon Musk	2016-06-15 15:10:29	@AstroOrionMK @BadAstronomer Quite rapid... Yes
743097668725940225	Elon Musk	2016-06-15 15:07:44	RUD = Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly :)
743097337782763521	Elon Musk	2016-06-15 15:06:26	Looks like thrust was low on 1 of 3 landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.
743096769001578498	Elon Musk	2016-06-15 15:04:10	Ascent phase &amp; satellites look good, but booster rocket had a RUD on droneship

742117913788719104	Elon Musk	2016-06-12 22:14:33	@seanmcarroll Am concerned that advanced life may be inherently unstable. Arguably, any civ capable of extinguishing itself eventually will.
742117250799280128	Elon Musk	2016-06-12 22:11:55	@seanmcarroll Life you can talk to is another matter, of course. Many, many orders of magnitude less likely.
742116619481014272	Elon Musk	2016-06-12 22:09:24	@seanmcarroll No way. Look at chemotrophs and extremophiles. Primitive life is bloody everywhere. Highly under the ice on Europa imo.
742115725477744640	Elon Musk	2016-06-12 22:05:51	@spoite @rsmoz Hence the urgency of making life as we know it multiplanetary as soon as possible

741442624611966976	Elon Musk	2016-06-11 01:31:11	@BenjaminRPhoto @StephenPace Yeah, that matches what we've found so far. More likely unhinged than nefarious.
741412152288808960	Elon Musk	2016-06-10 23:30:06	Would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none existed. Q is why?
741411531582115841	Elon Musk	2016-06-10 23:27:38	Of greater concern: 37 of 40 suspension complaints to NHTSA were fraudulent, i.e. false location or vehicle identification numbers were used
741410425787404288	Elon Musk	2016-06-10 23:23:14	NHTSA confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the Model S suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter
741341906999771136	Elon Musk	2016-06-10 18:50:58	@DefTechPat That is correct. It was about innovation.

736380977354657792	Elon Musk	2016-05-28 02:18:00	Fast replay of today's rocket landing on SpaceX droneship OCISLYhttps://t.co/I0QQ2D3BtE
736373856823181312	Elon Musk	2016-05-28 01:49:43	@dfjsteve Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard.
736328917317910528	Elon Musk	2016-05-27 22:51:08	Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
736320322996076548	Elon Musk	2016-05-27 22:16:59	Rocket landing speed was close to design max &amp; used up contingency crush core, hence back &amp; forth motion. Prob ok, but some risk of tipping.
736319295345434625	Elon Musk	2016-05-27 22:12:54	Satellite deployed to 91,000 km apogee. All looks good.
736310020644569088	Elon Musk	2016-05-27 21:36:03	3 mins to launch https://t.co/i5jNDs9MCO
735965207625932801	Elon Musk	2016-05-26 22:45:53	@SpaceX There was a tiny glitch in the motion of an upper stage engine actuator. Probably not a flight risk, but still worth investigating.

733021242744135680	Elon Musk	2016-05-18 19:47:37	@jlgolson No prob. We care about doing what's fair &amp; just. Don't always get it right, but intent is always there &amp; we make amends when wrong
733016945654517760	Elon Musk	2016-05-18 19:30:33	@jlgolson Per the letter, Tesla paid $55/hr for *additional* services, so no.
733009265288314881	Elon Musk	2016-05-18 19:00:02	@jlgolson Yes, but it is false of Merc News to say that Tesla took advantage of low cost labor. We paid $55/hr. That is unequivocal.
733007602565570560	Elon Musk	2016-05-18 18:53:25	We still need to make sure that the injured person is taken care of, but less &amp; less of the Merc story appears to be true
733007230149107712	Elon Musk	2016-05-18 18:51:56	Merc News story about Tesla using $5/hr labor seems to be missing a digit. Tesla actually paid $55/hr. https://t.co/2dTH0ncdKX
732656393463832576	Elon Musk	2016-05-17 19:37:50	@drkevinleung @Tesla_Canada Totally agree. Am told this will be fixed by Thurs, maybe Fri.
732330010053222400	Elon Musk	2016-05-16 22:00:55	@joshuapinter @juliusvolz Full height of Falcon 9 boost stage on legs is ~165 ft
732329443776024576	Elon Musk	2016-05-16 21:58:40	Falcon Heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as Falcon 9, but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer loads.

728514673084014593	Elon Musk	2016-05-06 09:20:07	@hansmikael @TeslaMotors Thank goodness all are ok
728462267893698561	Elon Musk	2016-05-06 05:51:53	Yeah, this was a three engine landing burn, so triple deceleration of last flight. That's important to minimize gravity losses.
728459808270000128	Elon Musk	2016-05-06 05:42:07	May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar
728457279943495681	Elon Musk	2016-05-06 05:32:04	Woohoo!! https://t.co/0P8n8VmFbr
728444313248489472	Elon Musk	2016-05-06 04:40:32	Rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time, so odds of making it are maybe even, but we should learn a lot either way
728327602440536064	Elon Musk	2016-05-05 20:56:46	Tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible, but I'd recommend ordering a Model 3 soon if you want 2018 delivery
728126194244190208	Elon Musk	2016-05-05 07:36:27	@samsamlee777 yes
727189428142235648	Elon Musk	2016-05-02 17:34:04	Filtering particulates from air makes a significant &amp; measurable diff to health. Wd like to credit Larry Page with turning me on to this.
727176162997313536	Elon Musk	2016-05-02 16:41:22	Bioweapon Defense Mode is real https://t.co/xGNLrOyhaQ This is what happens when you turn it on: https://t.co/LnkHzXTxqN
726919920374554625	Elon Musk	2016-05-01 23:43:09	@MacTechGenius @SacEV Have been reviewing end of line production quality personally. Slowed things down temporarily, but it's for the best.
726878573001216000	Elon Musk	2016-05-01 20:58:51	@JohanMancus Historical precedent. Mars vehicle will be metric.
726878466382041089	Elon Musk	2016-05-01 20:58:25	@SacEV next month (with a lot of other good stuff)
726829989119696896	Elon Musk	2016-05-01 17:45:47	@scottymeuk @DericLew @SpaceflightIns @phillipcjackson exactly

726812607298998272	Elon Musk	2016-05-01 16:36:43	@CyberdineX naturally
726651603906785285	Elon Musk	2016-05-01 05:56:57	Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff --  twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
726650591359819776	Elon Musk	2016-05-01 05:52:56	F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
726579536410734592	Elon Musk	2016-05-01 01:10:35	@elonmusk F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be 22,800 kg
726561442636263425	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 23:58:41	@lukealization No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers.
726560848177561600	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 23:56:19	@lukealization No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
726559990480150528	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 23:52:55	@elonmusk Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.
726559284306173952	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 23:50:06	@mattyteare Basically current, but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce 3 sigma reserve margin.
726557903205756928	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 23:44:37	Just posted latest max payload capabilities of Falcon 9 and Heavy https://t.co/Z45Y5V7G91

726217179683655680	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 01:10:42	@Tweetermeyer things like this should be purged shortly
726216836069515264	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 01:09:20	@RokBottomGamers 100+ for almost everything 10+ for heat shields and a few other items.
726215924760485888	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 01:05:43	@VivekMGeorge Zuck doesn't (yet) have a deep tech understanding of AI. I spend hours every week being educated by world's best researchers.
726214236368576512	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 00:59:01	@gdoehne JCSat is pushing the envelope as a very hot and fast mission, so will land on the droneship. Next land landing in a few months.
726213728278962176	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 00:56:59	@MrBoylan System scan detected only 0.2% of orders with same email and physical address. Those have been purged.
726210827699806208	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 00:45:28	@vigneshraju of course
726210366766632960	Elon Musk	2016-04-30 00:43:38	@maya_kazan Temporary spike in some areas due to X 3rd row seat recall. Should be sorted by June.
726183794215022592	Elon Musk	2016-04-29 22:58:03	@MrBoylan Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of 2 will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are 2, so speculation unlikely.
726127265612881920	Elon Musk	2016-04-29 19:13:25	@erothenberg Simple answer is that there just aren't many used Teslas available. Demand &gt;&gt; supply.
726125524091723777	Elon Musk	2016-04-29 19:06:30	@erothenberg checking into it ...
725367703045730304	Elon Musk	2016-04-27 16:55:11	@romn8tr will definitely do so
725366265322172416	Elon Musk	2016-04-27 16:49:28	@abraham_cavazos some places are trickier than others, but yes. That's the value of having a PICA-3 heat shield with propulsive landing.
725365829479460864	Elon Musk	2016-04-27 16:47:45	@Cardoso It could land on Venus no problem, but would last maybe a few hours. Tough local environment.
725365200098988032	Elon Musk	2016-04-27 16:45:14	But wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV.
725364699303301120	Elon Musk	2016-04-27 16:43:15	Dragon 2 is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system. Red Dragon Mars mission is the first test flight.
724160269480431620	Elon Musk	2016-04-24 08:57:17	@KristianNairn A 3 should be workable, but an S or particularly an X would be better
722893014507491329	Elon Musk	2016-04-20 21:01:40	@scottmcnealy That article was incredibly misleading and you should know it. Wager right now that Sun has received far more than Tesla?
722891148126060545	Elon Musk	2016-04-20 20:54:15	Looks like Model X resale value is holding up well :)https://t.co/4gedy9GCHA

722599856460529665	Elon Musk	2016-04-20 01:36:45	@RealDarthBL We have amplified pre-delivery inspection to provide a stronger second layer of QA. Several parts being replaced as a result.

718598132888702976	Elon Musk	2016-04-09 00:35:20	Just wanted to write a note of appreciation for all those who have supported Tesla, SpaceX &amp; SolarCity over the years. Thank you.
718580558180261888	Elon Musk	2016-04-08 23:25:30	@POTUS Thanks on behalf of an amazing team at SpaceX!

718522065322532865	Elon Musk	2016-04-08 19:33:04	@arstechnica Reasons for ocean landing are technical, not economic. Orbit requires extreme horizontal velocity. Getting to space needs none.

718112326889529344	Elon Musk	2016-04-07 16:24:55	Over 325k cars or ~$14B in preorders in first week. Only 5% ordered max of two, suggesting low levels of speculation.

717749079707484160	Elon Musk	2016-04-06 16:21:30	@Recode Dex will do comms, but my speeches are just a conversation w the audience. No time to rehearse &amp; don't want to read from a prompter.
717746816503062528	Elon Musk	2016-04-06 16:12:30	@maximumblue we will
717738859379843073	Elon Musk	2016-04-06 15:40:53	@LaurenShearer1 Doesn't sound right. Will check into it.
717612929214849024	Elon Musk	2016-04-06 07:20:29	@MThorpXXi We are working on enlarging the opening. Aperture will be big enough for almost anything.
717488049848889345	Elon Musk	2016-04-05 23:04:16	Most telling is that the SpaceX Propulsion CTO switched from driving a Porsche 911 Turbo S to a Model X

716778890744598528	Elon Musk	2016-04-04 00:06:19	@lordsshrivas Coming soon for all Tesla cars. Just an OTA software update.

716751456574025728	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 22:17:18	@GatorWass you can do that now with S and X. Will be same for 3.
716751300063531008	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 22:16:41	@_elombardo @rjpryan correct
716751152906440705	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 22:16:06	@EduardoForneck hopefully 0.21
716750603813318660	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 22:13:55	@PeteEhmKay @gerardomarina what's the link to that?
716750313471025152	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 22:12:45	@tapwin No, but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity.
716749717795946496	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 22:10:23	@mpatfield no problem
716749159324377089	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 22:08:10	@CrackedUpCorson Will cover whole country hopefully this year
716748255242100736	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 22:04:35	@AndersRytter yes, but production AWD will be a lot faster
716747844175142912	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 22:02:57	@AlexBelohlavek less
716747672477151232	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 22:02:16	@torvos torque is shifted between front &amp; rear motors every ~.01 secs. Traction control is way better than a normal AWD. Digital vs analog.
716745898202685441	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 21:55:13	And, of course, it will have more cowbells.
716745282394976257	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 21:52:46	Model 3 will be RWD, with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain.
716743909750218752	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 21:47:19	@GolfsHard yes
716743848580497409	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 21:47:04	@Zooropa88 @TeslaMotors Superchargers and service centers will cover all of Italy later this year

716742777468555264	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 21:42:49	@Alandbru @TeslaMotors should be addressed this year
716731407310196736	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 20:57:38	@CmaxVs Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.
716730641585340416	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 20:54:35	@iKrivetko that's not the real steering system
716730009394647040	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 20:52:05	@B_Rans yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
716729841362407424	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 20:51:25	@gerardomarina Some tweaking underway
716729420078133248	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 20:49:44	@HBL_Cosmin Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3. It feels like a spaceship.
716715017781915648	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 19:52:30	@MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
716714416801099782	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 19:50:07	@scottkelley99 Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.
716713492389044224	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 19:46:27	@_amwolo_ They can. Will be great for road trips and camping
716713294128500737	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 19:45:39	@BValvsRacing It will make sense after part 2 of the Model 3 unveil
716713023960784897	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 19:44:35	A Model 3 order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally.
716710938406047744	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 19:36:18	In general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome

716708661024804866	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 19:27:15	@SnoozeThroughF1 There will be an optional tow hitch.
716704636896284673	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 19:11:15	@RGspan Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non X/S customers to receive the credit.
716701798002610176	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 18:59:58	@jeffrey @neutyp Matte black was surprisingly popular. Probably makes sense to bring it to production.
716700979379372032	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 18:56:43	@WaltNew cool, thanks!
716696932073152512	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 18:40:38	@mindthreat @RyanHummer Yes, if the trend continues, before
716693951260938241	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 18:28:48	276k Model 3 orders by end of Sat
716510703000100865	Elon Musk	2016-04-03 06:20:38	Model 3 design sketches https://t.co/P5ucOBRUZ7
716356456593756160	Elon Musk	2016-04-02 20:07:43	@grebakshay We are working on an exact date, but Tesla will be in India before 3 production starts.
716356220156686336	Elon Musk	2016-04-02 20:06:46	@Model3Owners They will. We spent a lot of time on those.
716347450148040704	Elon Musk	2016-04-02 19:31:55	@vicentes Roadster, S and X customers are the ones who got us here and are paying for 3. They deserve a lot of credit.
716347036786757632	Elon Musk	2016-04-02 19:30:17	@Aakashhh_ we will send something to everyone who ordered, but an extra gift for those who stood in some crazy long lines
716346618035830784	Elon Musk	2016-04-02 19:28:37	@raytech247 yes, within a region. Can't deliver to all regions simultaneously. Too much complexity.
716346279391944704	Elon Musk	2016-04-02 19:27:16	@squallcraft and a few other things
716345597712670720	Elon Musk	2016-04-02 19:24:34	Token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via mail. Thought maybe 20-30 people per store would line up, not 800. Gifts on order.
716344348107878401	Elon Musk	2016-04-02 19:19:36	@34thrain Maybe 1/4 to 1/2 of what happened. No one at Tesla thought it would be this high before part 2 of the unveil.
716343274730991616	Elon Musk	2016-04-02 19:15:20	Will give an update tonight for the 3 day total, then last one on Wed for the full week. All efforts focused on accelerating the ramp.
716341849409998849	Elon Musk	2016-04-02 19:09:40	253k as of 7am this morning
716155418800730113	Elon Musk	2016-04-02 06:48:52	@sundarpichai thanks!

715999819437850624	Elon Musk	2016-04-01 20:30:34	@GrahamABlair of course :)
715975692228243460	Elon Musk	2016-04-01 18:54:41	@Jbourquee Giga is designed to self-power via solar panels (primarily), wind &amp; geo, using its own batteries to store electricity at night.
715974749982220288	Elon Musk	2016-04-01 18:50:57	@steveagee def on the cards for the future
715972980556193792	Elon Musk	2016-04-01 18:43:55	@JackLipstone should be within a week or two max
715971547475886083	Elon Musk	2016-04-01 18:38:13	@Alyssa_Milano Hi Alyssa, thanks for placing your faith in Tesla. I hope you have a great experience with the car.
715955186175459332	Elon Musk	2016-04-01 17:33:12	Definitely going to need to rethink production planning...
715952781895426048	Elon Musk	2016-04-01 17:23:39	Thought it would slow way down today, but Model 3 order count is now at 198k. Recommend ordering soon, as the wait time is growing rapidly.
715934657720639488	Elon Musk	2016-04-01 16:11:38	Model 3 orders at 180,000 in 24 hours. Selling price w avg option mix prob $42k, so ~$7.5B in a day. Future of electric cars looking bright!
715776577485807621	Elon Musk	2016-04-01 05:43:29	@IndiaToday Will include India-wide Supercharger network

715766837590499328	Elon Musk	2016-04-01 05:04:47	@redletterdave Hardware in all cars. Autopilot safety features standard. Convenience features optional (like S and X).
715765978328612870	Elon Musk	2016-04-01 05:01:22	@drew Just order the SpaceX option package!
715765746429784064	Elon Musk	2016-04-01 05:00:26	Thanks for tuning in to the Model 3 unveil Part 1! Part 2 is super next level, but that's for later‚Ä¶
715679848828575744	Elon Musk	2016-03-31 23:19:07	@lukealization yes, will cover whole country

715566236822671360	Elon Musk	2016-03-31 15:47:40	Incredibly inspired by the interest in Model 3. You won't be disappointed. Also, small token of appreciation coming for those who lined up.
715433418260029440	Elon Musk	2016-03-31 06:59:53	Model 3 unveil will be webcast live at 8:30pm California time at https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr
715309739752747009	Elon Musk	2016-03-30 22:48:26	@rossbin You will see the car very clearly, but some important elements will be added and some will evolve.
715307847890903041	Elon Musk	2016-03-30 22:40:55	Tomorrow is Part 1 of the Model 3 unveil. Part 2, which takes things to another level, will be closer to production.
715303533659041792	Elon Musk	2016-03-30 22:23:46	Model 3 order day starting in Australia https://t.co/T6aUnG5BCv
715220713326530561	Elon Musk	2016-03-30 16:54:40	You can now buy cruise ship tickets for the Arctic passage. Seeing is believing. https://t.co/LhKupkNMFC
715219872204992512	Elon Musk	2016-03-30 16:51:20	Great article by @BadAstronomer. Important to note max temp record. Too much attention on avg temp. Max matters most https://t.co/0FnIAVsbIu
714963420316049411	Elon Musk	2016-03-29 23:52:17	Looks like we may need to increase production plans for the Model 3 https://t.co/fmCPFC9FEm

710657482322915328	Elon Musk	2016-03-18 02:42:01	@RobGlaser sure
710625418856964096	Elon Musk	2016-03-18 00:34:37	@mikegaalsf Turn off recirc. Air exits thru rear vents. Snap in shade also avail from service, but I just tint the rear window.
707636460212490240	Elon Musk	2016-03-09 18:37:34	@Christianlguaje no
707632249340952577	Elon Musk	2016-03-09 18:20:50	The AEI meeting wasn't secret and I was only there for a few hours to talk about Mars and sustainable energy. Nothing to do with Trump.
707611375191744512	Elon Musk	2016-03-09 16:57:53	Congrats to DeepMind! Many experts in the field thought AI was 10 years away from achieving this. https://t.co/5gGZZkud3K
706612070041591808	Elon Musk	2016-03-06 22:47:00	SpaceX &amp; Tesla comp is same or better than other companies. Big diff is that we don't outsource manufacturing, retail sales or service.
706610504161107968	Elon Musk	2016-03-06 22:40:47	SpaceX and Tesla rated most meaningful work in high tech. Also, most stressful, but that goes with the territory.  https://t.co/y8s4UdMF5z
706185709481119745	Elon Musk	2016-03-05 18:32:48	@wk057 @TeslaMotors Wasn't done at my request. Good hacking is a gift.
705917924972736512	Elon Musk	2016-03-05 00:48:43	Rocket landed hard on the droneship. Didn't expect this one to work (v hot reentry), but next flight has a good chance.
705910704792973313	Elon Musk	2016-03-05 00:20:01	Target altitude of 40,600 km achieved. Thanks @SES_Satellites for riding on Falcon 9! Looking forward to future missions.
705687267684159488	Elon Musk	2016-03-04 09:32:10	@Astro_Valdric @TeslaMotors We spoke earlier today and he said he would investigate the situation.
705094397470179329	Elon Musk	2016-03-02 18:16:19	.@curtismcauliff SpaceX has not donated to any presidential campaign

704779047746691072	Elon Musk	2016-03-01 21:23:13	@lorengrush exactly :)
704770247769722880	Elon Musk	2016-03-01 20:48:15	Pushing launch to Friday due to extreme high altitude wind shear. Hits like a sledgehammer when going up supersonic https://t.co/Gr8T5upaLd
704603669786791936	Elon Musk	2016-03-01 09:46:20	@PernilleT Only heard about it today. Doesn't sound like they are in the right though in their dealings with our subcontractor.
704102461766676481	Elon Musk	2016-02-29 00:34:43	@SpaceX Launch aborted on low thrust alarm. Rising oxygen temps due to hold for boat and helium bubble triggered alarm.
704092857829732353	Elon Musk	2016-02-28 23:56:33	@SpaceX AF has placed launch on hold due to a boat entering the edge of the keep out zone. Scrambling helo to get them to move.
703760056827912197	Elon Musk	2016-02-28 01:54:07	@TLKFremont Great leg room for 3rd row, rear visibility better, easy storage of long cargo.
703692375055413248	Elon Musk	2016-02-27 21:25:10	@derekslager @skiesforme yes, it actually performed better than other colors on stain tests. Best not to have vented seats w kids though.
703650455407079424	Elon Musk	2016-02-27 18:38:36	@skiesforme Can't emphasize enough that white is the best interior. Also, pick 6 seats unless you really need 7.
703636763227484161	Elon Musk	2016-02-27 17:44:11	@skiesforme @TeslaMotors That said, the white interior is the best. Highly recommend.
703636644704849921	Elon Musk	2016-02-27 17:43:43	@skiesforme Heavy use of the white causes splitting. Adding backing material to strengthen. Will be upgraded at no cost.
702534707464896512	Elon Musk	2016-02-24 16:45:01	Worth reposting the Wait But Why piece on AI. We are at the beginning of exponential growth in digital intelligence.https://t.co/1c30ZwrxQ1

701548454460284929	Elon Musk	2016-02-21 23:26:00	There is no way it is only 0.5%, given the staggeringly massive number of fossil subsidies that exist in every country, or as high as 50%.
701547612747345921	Elon Musk	2016-02-21 23:22:39	Global economy of $100T is overwhelmingly fossil fuel based, so IMF estimate of $5T or 5% for carbon subsidy is def right order of magnitude
701222643278548993	Elon Musk	2016-02-21 01:51:20	Just wanted to thank Stu G for https://t.co/7FlnbruWpL. Know it meant a lot to you. Will take good care.

700600176713404416	Elon Musk	2016-02-19 08:37:53	Worth noting that all gasoline cars are heavily subsidized via oil company tax credits &amp; unpaid public health costs https://t.co/4li5E013Dj

700400899991011328	Elon Musk	2016-02-18 19:26:02	@msb17 yeah, that's a great one too :)
700400754943627264	Elon Musk	2016-02-18 19:25:27	@AnnaDotBlue Little bit
700400342047961088	Elon Musk	2016-02-18 19:23:49	Worth watching "Nathan for You" on Comedy Central, particularly the "Dumb Starbucks" and "Mechanic/Realtor" episodes
700398127044362240	Elon Musk	2016-02-18 19:15:00	My coffee tastes unusually good this morning https://t.co/LowwuPAgoz

699709623406702592	Elon Musk	2016-02-16 21:39:08	Interesting to think of physics as a set of compression algorithms for the universe. That's basically what formulas are.
699510738147106816	Elon Musk	2016-02-16 08:28:50	@chriskreidler @engadget yes, this was done jointly with Tesla and Radio Flyer

697682665919516672	Elon Musk	2016-02-11 07:24:44	@MysteryGuitarM yes
697679828468641792	Elon Musk	2016-02-11 07:13:28	No signature series for Model 3. Same reservation amount for all.
697679434996850688	Elon Musk	2016-02-11 07:11:54	@garethseneque global
697678962588188672	Elon Musk	2016-02-11 07:10:01	Model 3 reservations ($1000 down) will be accepted in Tesla stores on March 31 and online April 1
697674277131153408	Elon Musk	2016-02-11 06:51:24	@ErikRoesegg good point
697341715712086016	Elon Musk	2016-02-10 08:49:55	Should mention that Tesla Motors itself had nothing to do with the short movie. This was completely independent.
697331144417619968	Elon Musk	2016-02-10 08:07:55	Love this Tesla video made by https://t.co/bwKne0mZUh
695666033676328960	Elon Musk	2016-02-05 17:51:21	My job moonlighting as a police officer in Brazil is no longer secrethttps://t.co/QBTQYMpAF9
694802955170553861	Elon Musk	2016-02-03 08:41:47	Must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer gets this much attention
690983158490136576	Elon Musk	2016-01-23 19:43:17	@TheEconomist Interesting name
689869015280254976	Elon Musk	2016-01-20 17:56:05	@Benzinga I didn't take anyone's car and never would. Car was actually allocated to engineering test (not by me) and inadvertently sold.
689299216607232000	Elon Musk	2016-01-19 04:11:54	My best guess for 2016: ~70% landing success rate (so still a few more RUDs to go), then hopefully improving to ~90% in 2017
688921087820705792	Elon Musk	2016-01-18 03:09:21	@JeffBezos @SpaceX Thanks Jeff
688920586391805952	Elon Musk	2016-01-18 03:07:21	Falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs, causing it‚Ä¶ https://t.co/DpXsRQWal9
688846973361721345	Elon Musk	2016-01-17 22:14:51	@stunt_penguin @LayOn_OverWhale Stage 1 would reach low Earth orbit if not hefting a second stage, but payload would be greatly reduced.
688846557949472768	Elon Musk	2016-01-17 22:13:12	@JimmyVosika Actually, didn't get environmental approval in time, but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed.
688845689023901696	Elon Musk	2016-01-17 22:09:45	If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h.
688844190826942465	Elon Musk	2016-01-17 22:03:47	Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
688842435955261440	Elon Musk	2016-01-17 21:56:49	As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed.
688841295364673536	Elon Musk	2016-01-17 21:52:17	@mbhnyc steel collet
688837706005131264	Elon Musk	2016-01-17 21:38:01	Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing. https://t.co/w007TccANJ
688816810754359297	Elon Musk	2016-01-17 20:14:59	@Uncle_Gus probably
688816554306191360	Elon Musk	2016-01-17 20:13:58	However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing.
688814634489413632	Elon Musk	2016-01-17 20:06:21	Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating.
688175650570547202	Elon Musk	2016-01-16 01:47:15	Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
688173528017850368	Elon Musk	2016-01-16 01:38:49	Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine 9 showed thrust fluctuations.
686976300158853120	Elon Musk	2016-01-12 18:21:28	Next launch is a @NASA science mission from VAFB California on Sunday. https://t.co/vJdkJkZzg1

686472796797579266	Elon Musk	2016-01-11 09:00:43	Sad to hear that David Bowie died. He was amazing.
686279251293777920	Elon Musk	2016-01-10 20:11:38	In ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land &amp; not blocked by borders, eg you're in LA and the car is in NY
686278452639567876	Elon Musk	2016-01-10 20:08:28	Tap your phone or key and your car will open the garage door, exit, close the door and come to you. Will do same in reverse for unsummon.
686277508212330496	Elon Musk	2016-01-10 20:04:43	First baby step in Tesla Summon capability now downloading over-the-air with V7.1

678679083782377472	Elon Musk	2015-12-20 20:51:17	Just reviewed mission params w SpaceX team. Monte Carlo runs show tmrw night has a 10% higher chance of a good landing. Punting 24 hrs.
678152249369952258	Elon Musk	2015-12-19 09:57:50	Currently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral
678065851199651840	Elon Musk	2015-12-19 04:14:31	Meant to reply to this article: https://t.co/JRvXcTG3el
678065339649757184	Elon Musk	2015-12-19 04:12:29	This article does not appreciate that Tesla is in California despite taxes net of rebates being higher. Incentives only a partial offset.
678004229047357440	Elon Musk	2015-12-19 00:09:39	Static fire test looks good. Pending data review, will aim to launch Sunday.
677980503459270657	Elon Musk	2015-12-18 22:35:22	Rounding up to 1 sec for a bit of timing margin. Updating flight computer command sequence ‚Ä¶
677970721730002944	Elon Musk	2015-12-18 21:56:30	Aborted on ignition timing due to slow ground side valve. Adjusting ignition sequence by 0.6 secs for next attempt.
677961117595906048	Elon Musk	2015-12-18 21:18:21	About 2 mins from static fire
677949037815840768	Elon Musk	2015-12-18 20:30:20	@elonmusk holding for issue resolution
677945101184708609	Elon Musk	2015-12-18 20:14:42	Abort triggered by flight computer on upper stage throttle valve. Adjusting thresholds and restarting count at T-10 mins.
677940293212102656	Elon Musk	2015-12-18 19:55:36	5 mins from static fire test
677666779494248449	Elon Musk	2015-12-18 01:48:45	@lukealization yes, from 70F to 20 F
677666464208416768	Elon Musk	2015-12-18 01:47:30	@craigcocca It worked in Texas
677663227271118848	Elon Musk	2015-12-18 01:34:38	@PaigeANjax -340 F in this case. Deep cryo increases density and amplifies rocket performance. First time anyone has gone this low for O2.
677660460230041600	Elon Musk	2015-12-18 01:23:38	Falcon 9 is vertical on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Working towards static fire. Deep cryo liquid oxygen presenting some challenges.
677646796311670786	Elon Musk	2015-12-18 00:29:20	@mashabletech @mashable Not really my letter (no authorship contribution). Just agreed to add my name when they asked.
677403793651175424	Elon Musk	2015-12-17 08:23:44	Vance article on self-driving cars was inaccurate https://t.co/AV636KAcKH

669209994693251075	Elon Musk	2015-11-24 17:44:30	@ID_AA_Carmack Yep, good points. I hope you get back into space some day!
669202543109509120	Elon Musk	2015-11-24 17:14:54	But credit for 1st reusable suborbital rocket goes to X-15 https://t.co/LSb0f8FLJdAnd Burt Rutan for commercialhttps://t.co/TGWlNjsyQz
669199392231063552	Elon Musk	2015-11-24 17:02:22	Jeff maybe unaware SpaceX suborbital VTOL flight began 2013. Orbital water landing 2014. Orbital land landing next. https://t.co/S6WMRnEFY5
669194136248041472	Elon Musk	2015-11-24 16:41:29	@JeffBezos Not quite "rarest". SpaceX Grasshopper rocket did 6 suborbital flights 3 years ago &amp; is still around. https://t.co/6j9ERKCNZl
669132749500887040	Elon Musk	2015-11-24 12:37:34	@TobiasVdb The F9 booster can reach low orbit as a single stage if not carrying the upper stage and a heavy satellite.
669131093379956736	Elon Musk	2015-11-24 12:30:59	Getting to space needs ~Mach 3, but GTO orbit requires ~Mach 30. The energy needed is the square, i.e. 9 units for space and 900 for orbit.
669129655597731841	Elon Musk	2015-11-24 12:25:16	It is, however, important to clear up the difference between "space" and "orbit", as described well by https://t.co/7PD42m37fZ
669129347555430400	Elon Musk	2015-11-24 12:24:02	Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO team for achieving VTOL on their booster
667537317037404160	Elon Musk	2015-11-20 02:57:53	@levie Sounds perfect, you had me at "enterprise".
667536629830017024	Elon Musk	2015-11-20 02:55:09	@StartupLJackson Yeah and hell yeah
667519604537724928	Elon Musk	2015-11-20 01:47:30	@atduarte From anywhere
667519445414252544	Elon Musk	2015-11-20 01:46:52	Should mention that I will be interviewing people personally and Autopilot reports directly to me. This is a super high priority.
667517215390863360	Elon Musk	2015-11-20 01:38:00	We are looking for hardcore software engineers. No prior experience with cars required. Please include code sample or link to your work.
667516705116065792	Elon Musk	2015-11-20 01:35:59	Ramping up the Autopilot software team at Tesla to achieve generalized full autonomy. If interested, contact autopilot@teslamotors.com.
663290006992236544	Elon Musk	2015-11-08 09:40:35	@drew definitely aliens!
662039125898334209	Elon Musk	2015-11-04 22:50:02	@kevinmitnick Current production is LTE. Can be upgraded by service.
661293692410445824	Elon Musk	2015-11-02 21:27:57	@BjornNyland @TeslaMotors well done!
660693896553324545	Elon Musk	2015-11-01 05:44:34	@ID_AA_Carmack noted
660117630175412224	Elon Musk	2015-10-30 15:34:42	@GertAbildskov Wow, that's great!
659543458953101312	Elon Musk	2015-10-29 01:33:08	Model S Ludicrous Mode achieves 2.6 sec 0-60 mph and 10.9 sec 1/4 mile in Motor Trend test https://t.co/IpgTF6s9M8
659541500712251392	Elon Musk	2015-10-29 01:25:22	@MacTechGenius yes, comes with each car
658842380922023936	Elon Musk	2015-10-27 03:07:18	Compliment from Jeffrey is much appreciated, but the people of Tesla deserve all the credit
658780657103978496	Elon Musk	2015-10-26 23:02:02	I should clarify that https://t.co/iUX7wkMxY8 is an independent website. We don't have any control over the content.
658735748498100225	Elon Musk	2015-10-26 20:03:35	Cool! https://t.co/HOe0K7qkuk
658657239331270656	Elon Musk	2015-10-26 14:51:37	@anakinSGE Hopefully, mid to late next year. We are being more cautious abt expanding countries to ensure a great user experience each time.
658358794292891648	Elon Musk	2015-10-25 19:05:42	@GangsOfGtown Given high local demand, a Gigafactory in India would probably make sense in the long term.
658358303454420992	Elon Musk	2015-10-25 19:03:45	@abrax4s Yes, establishing charging and service infrastructure in Mexico now. Official launch in next several months.
658357909265362944	Elon Musk	2015-10-25 19:02:11	@javashri Auto import duties are prohibitively high. Hoping for a special category for EVs. Most of our discussion was about batteries.
658357058106822656	Elon Musk	2015-10-25 18:58:48	@roneijlander We just finished building a huge expansion in Tilburg!
658356679793205248	Elon Musk	2015-10-25 18:57:18	These are all things I've said before and are naturally needed to improve in-market affordability, so no real news here.
658356079026270208	Elon Musk	2015-10-25 18:54:55	Model 3 is due in ~2 yrs. A China factory for local demand cd be as soon as a year after. A factory in Europe wd happen for same reason.
658354915824173056	Elon Musk	2015-10-25 18:50:18	My comments in China weren't transcribed correctly. Tesla will keep making cars &amp; batteries in CA &amp; NV as far into future as I can imagine.
657704144267059200	Elon Musk	2015-10-23 23:44:22	@JessicaTetreau important to set AC to not recirc (air exits thru rear) and use the snap in shade, which Tesla service can provide
657702829398822912	Elon Musk	2015-10-23 23:39:08	@shanenickerson Amount of change needed is enormous - like a spinal cord transplant. Would cost less and work better with a new car.
657686500310700032	Elon Musk	2015-10-23 22:34:15	Autopilot 1.01 coming soon: curve speed adaption, controller smoothness, better lane holding on poor roads, improved fleet learning!
657685372579745793	Elon Musk	2015-10-23 22:29:46	Regulatory approvals received, so Autopilot rolling out to all countries! (Excluding Japan, which is still under review)
657141296050606080	Elon Musk	2015-10-22 10:27:48	@JarkkoKuoppala all
657110887707361280	Elon Musk	2015-10-22 08:26:58	@backseatdiver Hoping for Friday release
657106581893574656	Elon Musk	2015-10-22 08:09:52	@elonmusk Good feedback. Will write up a list of software priorities in the coming weeks.
656973991379378176	Elon Musk	2015-10-21 23:23:00	What esthetic and functionality improvements would you like to see in the 7.1 UI overhaul? Or new features entirely?
656973325172920320	Elon Musk	2015-10-21 23:20:21	@sAlmaneei already in Jordan. Rest of states in region next year.
656973144306094080	Elon Musk	2015-10-21 23:19:38	@bonnienorman thanks Bonnie :)
656972712649359360	Elon Musk	2015-10-21 23:17:55	@M4XRodri planning to have a big opening in Mexico City soon and then proceed gradually to central and South America.
656972435401678848	Elon Musk	2015-10-21 23:16:49	@octomagon me too:
656972046639984644	Elon Musk	2015-10-21 23:15:16	@jonthomason yay! Always happy to make others happy
656971866163277825	Elon Musk	2015-10-21 23:14:33	@thebradholt big UI update coming in V7.1
656971573337944065	Elon Musk	2015-10-21 23:13:23	@ryybuzz we won't be, but yes
656970996801474560	Elon Musk	2015-10-21 23:11:06	Tesla gets top rating of any company in service. Most important, CR says 97% of owners expect their next car to be a Tesla (the acid test).
656970117721534464	Elon Musk	2015-10-21 23:07:36	Consumer Reports reliability survey includes a lot of early production cars. Already addressed in new cars.
